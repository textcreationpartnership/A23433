            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an excellent ſaying, which we finde in that diuine booke intituled <hi>THE FOLLOWING OF CHRIST: The felicitie, which is to be obtayned in this life, conſiſts not, in the being able to preuent or auoid miſeries, and croſſes, which daily occurre; but in the patient and humble acceptation and ſufferance thereof.</hi> For indeede, there is no ſuch thing as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not being encountred and croſſed, ſome in one kinde, and ſome in another; ſome, by deſolations of minde; ſome by infirmities of bodie; ſome by want of temporall mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, ſome by vnkindeneſſe of freinds; ſome by detraction againſt fame, ſome by ſuites in law; and ſome by perſecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For theſe things lye as ſo manie ſnares, whereby to intrappe our patience, in this great Hoſpitall of the world; and ſome men are ſubject to more of them, and
<pb facs="tcp:15877:3"/>ſome to fewer; but there is no man, who at one time or other, is not ſubiect to ſome. The buſineſſe therefore muſt be, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte both ſuch as Almighty God, shall either ſend for the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our other ſinnes, or for the greater purification and perfection of our owne ſoules; or for the aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his owne glory otherwiſe; and ſuch others alſo, as for the greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of wicked men, he shall permitt them to inflict vpon vs; and to ſupporte them ſo, through the fauour of God, as not onely thereby not to forfeite heauen in the next life, but to enable vs in the midſt of all our miſeries, to obtaine a kinde of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen in this. For I account it to be a kinde of heauen in the crowde of trouble, not to be ouerweighed with the burthen, but to accept, &amp; be content with the good will of God, and to aſpire towards an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Paſſion of Chriſt our Lord, &amp; to know and feele in our very harts, the ſubſtantiall &amp; ſauorie truth of that diuine ſaying of S. Iean Chriſoſtome: <hi>It is a more glorious thing for a man to ſuffer for Chriſt, then to raigne with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, as this doctrine is diuine, ſo the leſſon, whereby we are to learne it, is
<pb facs="tcp:15877:3"/>hard; and therefore we shall doe well to vſe the beſt meanes, we can, to take it out. And for my parte I muſt confeſſe, that I haue neuer mett in anie Authour, with ſo manie, ſo weightie, ſo eaſie, and practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſiderations, and inducements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not onely the patient, but euen the ioyfull ſufferance of all thoſe croſſes and afflictions, which can finde the way to vs in this world, as are deliuered by <hi>FATHER AVILA</hi> in his Epiſtles; whereof I haue ſelected the chiefe, and choice, and made them ſpeake with our tongue; to the end, that we may be the better taught, to beare thoſe burthens of affliction, which may otherwiſe proue too hard and heauie, for our ſoft shoulders of flesh and bloud. And I am confidently perſwaded, that beſides the entertainement, which the reader will finde therein otherwiſe, for his delight and guſt; it will be impoſſible for him, to haue had, or haue a croſſe of anie kinde, for which he shall not heere finde ſtore of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and comforts brought to his hand. So that he will owe a diligent, and deuout reading to this Collection; if not for the Author's or Tranſlator's ſake, yet at leaſt, for his owne.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE peace of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> be euer with you. I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a letter of yours ſome daies paſt, written in <hi>Seuill;</hi> whereof though I were very gladd, yet should I haue reioyced much more, to be there to enioy your conuerſation, which I haue ſoe long deſired.

It is the ſentence of Chriſt our Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that if our right eye be an occaſion to vs of ſinne, wee muſt pluck it out and caſt it from vs. The right eye,</hi> is the loue which we carry towards goods, or honour, or life, or freinds; which, if by the inordinate aboundance thereof, it be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to vs of ſinne, wee are to eſtraunge our ſelues from it, and to cutt it of, leaſt otherwiſe we be eſtraunged from God.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt <hi>loue</hi> nothing ſoe well, as that wee may not treade it vnder foote, if it hinder vs from being well with God. There is noe ſuch thing, as holding freindſhip with that ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne king, but onely ſuch a man as will confeſſe, that heauen is had very cheape, though it ſhould chance to coſt him his life. They who will thinke to comply both with their owne proper affections, and with the loue alſo of our Lord, are mightily deceiued. For theis men <hi>loue</hi> not God, but ſoe as they alſoe <hi>loue</hi> many other things, whereas God will be loued, aboue them all.</p>
               <p>O errour of the ſonnes of men; and who hath thus deceiued them, and whoe ſhall be able to vnbeguile them? who hath pluckt out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15877:5"/>their eyes to leade them blinde-fould, in a ringe like another <hi>Sampſon,</hi>

                     <hi>Iudges.</hi> 16.</note> liuing according to the ſuggeſtion of vice, and in the diſpleaſure of our Lord? Who ſhall be able to make them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they are ſtraungely deceiued in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king riches in the firſt place, and vertue, in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Yea and if it ſoe fall out, that both of them cannot be kept, men are content to be without vertue, ſoe that they may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money. And thus put they <hi>light,</hi> into the place of <hi>darkenes;</hi> and <hi>darkenes</hi> into that of <hi>light.</hi> O that our Lord would open the eyes of theis men! and how bitterly would they weepe, ſeeing how badd exchaungers they had beene? Is not perhaps the freindſhip of God, which is obteyned by the exerciſe of vertue, of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, then all the reſt of things, which can be wiſhed? Are not perhapps <hi>the commaundements of God more worthy to be deſired then thouſands of gold and ſiluer?</hi> where ſhall we finde a true paire of ſcales to weigh euery thing out, for iuſt as much as it is; that ſoe we may not thus for euer liue in lyes.</p>
               <p>Men fly as farre as they cann from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, in their temporall ſtates. But why fly they not with greater diligence from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in ſome what els, which imports them more? They complaine if they be coſened in halfe the worth of any thing, which they are to buy; yea and there is noe meanes to appeaſe them, but they will needes be ſeeking a remedy againſt that abuſe. And yet they are very ready,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15877:6"/>to looſe their ſoules for a little gaine, or for an act of murmurring, or ſome other ſinne. And we cannot ſoe much as preuaile with them, to the end that they may haue ſome feeling of it, and ſay I am deceiued, let ſoe great a wrong as this, be remoued.</p>
               <p>That ſoule, O men which you are looſing, is more worth then all that which can be giuen you, in exchaunge thereof; what doe you gett by gayning it all, if you looſe your ſelues alone? what doth it profitt you to ſee euery body good, if withall your ſelues be wicked? what doth it profitt you, to gaine and growe great in point of fortune, with preiudice to your ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? and to be mighty in the ſight of men, but not to be acknowledged in the ſight of God?</p>
               <p>The day will come, infallibly it will come, when <hi>God will deſtroy all them whoe worke iniquity;</hi> and for what then will that ſerue, to which they haue moſt pretended heere? O day of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing accounte for all the daies of our liues, how little art thou conſidered, and therefore how little art thou feared. And men, in the meane tyme runne with the bridle looſe, and in their teeth, for the gathering of this little miſerable flower which ſoe quickly Fades, and they ſee with their very eyes, that it is euen ſlipping from betweene their fingers; and yet, there is neuer want of ſome body, who hath a minde to hould faſt this world, whilſt ſtill it is flying ſpeedily from them.</p>
               <p>Sir our true repoſe, and our kingdome, is not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15877:6"/>to be had in this world. What is this life, but a way from our owne houſes reaching to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, where theeues deſire to cutt our throates; ſince euery day we walke on more and more, and it is noe whether els, but towards death. Now who would be ſoe abſurdly inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, as that when he were to be conducted to execution, and that much haſt were vſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, the delinquent ſhould yet, fall into great aflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe lie were not ſumptuouſly cladd; or who in ſuch a caſe, would attend to buſy himſelfe about hearing ſome relation of the liues of others, or would delight himſelfe, with looking vpon ſome publick entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and paſtime? Or would put himſelfe to ſtudy what the reaſon might be, why men put not of their hatts to him, with a good graces And yet how many doe wee ſee (through our ſinnes) depriued of all ſenſe, who (goeing, as we all doe, to that reſting place of their graues; yea and running faſter thither, then any arrow flyes out of a bowe,) doe yet detaine themſelues fooliſhly, ſome vpon fine cloathes; others, vpon a certaine paltry ſmoake of honour, and others, who grow angry at the hart, becauſe iuſt that which they deſire, is not done.

A man who hath a minde to gaine this kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is not bound to become bankrupt, or to be a beggar, but that which he needes is, that for the loue of this kingdome, hee cutt of all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inordinate <hi>loue</hi> which he may carry to riches, and to honour, and to a delicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull life, and in fine to his owne <hi>proper will.</hi> Chriſt our lord will haue vs all naked, that ſoe we may runne on apace to him, who dyed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for vs. That man is <hi>naked,</hi> who houlds his life, and his <hi>honour,</hi> laid vnder, and in ſubiection to the will of Chriſt our Lord, doeing what Chriſt will, and not that, which is ſuggeſted by pleaſure, or honour; and who makes as light account of theſe things, as if he had them not;

And though perhaps a man may attend to the improuement of his eſtate; it muſt not be for the loue, which he carryes to it; but becauſe God commaunds it. If he liue, it muſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loues life, as making that the end of his care; but he muſt keepe it, for the ſeruice of God; and ſooner throwe it away, then offend him. If he be to aparell himſelfe, he muſt not take counſaile with vanity how he may be eſteemed for his cloathes; but with the word of our Lord which commaunds that we vſe them not with ſuperfluity, but for the ſupply of iuſt neceſſity. And ſoe this kinde of man, doth not hould himſelfe to be his owne, but as one who belongs wholly to God. He cares not, for what himſelfe deſires, but for that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds. He layes all things, and himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to be trodden vpon, vnder foot; for ſoe he may hould God aboue his head.

               <p>Great thankes doe we owe to Chriſt our Lord, for hauing warned vs of this ſoe longe before, that ſoe if we will thinke thereon, we may not finde our ſelues deceiued by him, who ſoe deerely loued vs. His aduertiſſement is this. <hi>Not euery one whoe ſaith to mee Lord, Lord, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen; but he shall enter in who doth the will of my Father, who is in heauen.</hi> What neede haue wee of any more, ſince the word of Chriſt our Lord can neuer faile? And who is that man, who will not awake with this. For the queſtion is not now, concerning any earthly kingdome, but the kingdome of heauen; ſince noe man enters thither but he who ſhall haue done the will of God. Let this therefore, be our ſtudy, let this be our diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, let vs counſaile men to this, and let vs in fine obſerue vigilantly, if we doe any thing which carryes not true conformitie, with the will of our Lord. And becauſe our owne watchfulnes will not ſuffice, lett vs call vpon our Lord, that hee may aſſiſt vs. Let vs acknowledge our owne miſery, and let vs cordyally implore his mercie.

And he ſhall be heard when he calls, who was content to hearken to his neighbour, when he was called vpon by him; and whoe aſſiſted him in his neceſſities, and who pardoned his errours, and who neither did ill to him, nor refuſed patiently to ſuffer ill from him.</p>

               <p>THE Infant <hi>Ieſus</hi> whoe was borne for our good, make you partaker of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which he brings, ſince he tooke thoſe miſeries vpon him to which we were ſubject; I beſeech him to giue you that liuely fire of his loue, wherein you may burne vp with a quick flame; ſince to kindle this loue in vs, he came into the world; ſoe poore, and ſoe froſen with cold. How much more cold this Infant ſuffers, ſoe much more warme doth he cloath our harts towards the loue of him. And by how much the more, we loue him, ſoe much the more doe we deſire to ſuffer for him. For loue flyes from taking eaſe; as from a thing which is very contrary to the intention and end thereof. For whileſt others are ſeeking for libertie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, he whoe loues abhors this, and deſires to be eternally a ſlaue, and to be euer labouring for whome he loues.</p>

Certainely noe other thing but <hi>Loue</hi> could haue brought him as it were, all bound from heauen, to the moſt pure wombe of our Bleſſed Lady, and from that wombe, it brought him to that hard manger, and from thence, to many other afflictions, and ſoe at laſt to the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> where louing vs with much truth of loue, he procured that we might truely loue him, as himſelfe had ſaid before. <hi>If I be exalted from the earth, I will draw all things vp to my ſelfe.</hi>

               <p>You therefore my good lady, may well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, you may reioyce in God, ſince you are well protected vnder a mantle which is both ſoe ſoft, and ſoe ſtronge.

And now ſince this Bleſſed Lord of ours, will be glorified in vs, and will take the honour of our victorie to himſelfe, he will alſoe take the care of our combatt, and hee will enable vs to paſſe through it to him; and will tye vs to himſelfe, with ſoe ſtronge a knott of loue, that neither life, nor death, ſhall diuide vs.</p>

               <p>Let vs not therefore be diſturbed, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed. Let vs not put others to paine, for the trouble which this continuall warre giues vs, in

And how, tepid and negligent perſons greiue that ſpirit, &amp; how the Feaſt of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is a very good preparation for the Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chiſti</hi> which followes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MADAM, I deſire to know how your hart ſtandes affected at this tyme. For if wee looke to the weeke, wherein wee are, it is belonging to the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> whoſe property is to giue light to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to infuſe loue into the will; and euen ſtrength into the body alſoe; by meanes of which three loaues of bread, we ſhall haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me what to ſet before our freind, who comes hungry, and weary from the high way. For the hunger that our hart feeles (which walkes as it were out of it ſelfe whileſt it imployes it ſelfe vpon creatures) this <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is wont to take away, and to giue vs the bread of fulnes, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15877:17"/>And woe be to vs, if we feele not that great defect, which is in things created; and if we conuert nor our ſelues to god in our very harts; at leaſt now when they are weary, with finding imperfections, &amp; wants, in thoſe things, wherein we hoped that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine repoſe.</p>
               <p>O my deere God, and when ſhall we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſoules in perfect faith and puritie towards thee, and be ſincerely loyall to <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> our Lord, who is the ſpouſe thereof, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him our loue, all intyre, and wholly free, from mingling itſelfe with the baſenes of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures? When ſhall we be able to vnderſtand this truth, that he who is to owne our ſoules, is Chriſt our Lord, and that he created vs for himſelfe, and that he onely is fitt for vs? Is it not enough, that we haue tryed ſo often by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how ill the world is wont to ſerue vs; and that our ſoule could neuer finde any true repoſe or peace, but onely when coming to knowe her owne miſery, and poorenes, it went to God, and was imbraced by him. Is not one of thoſe ſhort fitts of tyme more worth then their whole life, who ſacrifice themſelues to vanitie, and to the confuſion of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant world, wherein they liue?

How ſhall I be able to ſpeake to you of that <hi>Loue,</hi> which is ſubiect to noe intereſt, and is accompanyed with noe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe-loue; and lookes towards noe other marke, and aymes at noe other ſcope, but onely God? How I ſay, ſhall I ſpeake of it, whome my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> hath left all wrapped vp in mine owne intereſt, and who apply my ſelfe, to ſeeke my ſelfe in all things. See how much. For euen in thoſe things, which concerne the ſeruice of God, wee doe ſoe hang towards our ſelues, that many tymes wee performe them for our owne intereſt, or end. And though the workes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be holy, yet the loue wherewith wee doe them, is impure. And the difference doth onely conſiſt in this; that when wee ſeeke our ſelues by euill workes; our <hi>Loue</hi> runnes through a conduit of clay; &amp; when we ſeeke our ſelues
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15877:21"/>by good workes, it runnes indeede through a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duit of gould, but in fine it runnes towards our ſelues.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6</note> I beſeech our true doctour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, (<hi>who euer ſought the honour of his Father;</hi> and whoſe <hi>loue</hi> abaſed him to this world, not for the accompliſhing of his owne will, but his who ſent him) that he will vnty my tongue, to the end that I may tell you ſome part of that which you demaunde. For certainly, if your good deſire did not oblige me to lett you know what I haue read, my poorenes would oblige mee to hould my peace.</p>
               <p>And now to the end that you might better vnderſtand, what <hi>Charitie</hi> is; and how you may euer goe, imployed therein, I could wiſh you knew, ſome parte of that <hi>Loue,</hi> which the Bleſſed ſpiritts haue in heauen, to the end that you may know thereby, wherein true <hi>Charitie</hi> doth conſiſt. For how much neerer we ſhall come to that loue, ſo much the more perfect, will our <hi>loue</hi> be, you muſt know that the <hi>loue</hi> which is in heauen, doth transforme the Saints, into the ſame <hi>will</hi> with that of our lord God. For one of the effects of <hi>loue,</hi> as S. Dioniſius ſaith, is, to make the ſeuerall <hi>wills</hi> of ſuch as <hi>loue,</hi> to be but one; I meane, that they ſhould haue the ſame <hi>will,</hi> and the ſame <hi>not will,</hi> which the other hath. And now ſince the <hi>will,</hi> and loue, which our lord hath, is but onely of his owne glory, and of his eſſence which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely perfect, and glorious, from hence it followes that the <hi>loue</hi> of the Saints, is a Loue;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15877:21"/>and <hi>will,</hi> wherewith they loue, and deſire, with all their ſtrength, that our lord God, may in himſelfe be ſtill as good, as glorious, and as worthy of honour as hee is. And for as much as they ſee all that, to be already in him, which they can deſire, there followes there vpon;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the fruite of the holy ghoſt,</hi> which is an vnſpeakeable ioy, to ſee him whome they loue ſoe much, to be ſoe full of treaſures, and felicitie in himſelfe, as they deſire.</p>
               <p>If you will haue a touch; or at leaſt ſome little ſent of this diuine <hi>ioye,</hi> doe but conſider how great that <hi>ioy</hi> is, which a good Sonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues; in ſeeing his father whome he loues much, full of honour, beloued by all, rich, powerfull, hoble, and very much eſteemed by the king. Certainely there be ſonnes ſoe gratefull, and well diſpoſed to their parents, as to eſteeme, that nothing can be compared to the ioy, of ſeeing their fathers ſoe eſteemed; which reaches indeede ſoe farre, as that to whatſoeuer neceſſitie, or affliction themſelues may be ſubiect, it ſerues not to depriue them of that great <hi>ioy,</hi> becauſe they aſpire to noe other end but onely the honor of their parents.</p>
               <p>Now if this ioy be ſoe great what doe you conceiue, that the <hi>ioy</hi> of the Saints may be; when being transformed by <hi>loue,</hi> into that true lord of theirs, the vniuerſall creatour of all things; they ſhall ſee him, ſoe full of goodnes ſoe holy and ſoe rich in beauty; and that he is a Lord, and creatour, ſoe infinitely powerfull, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15877:22"/>that by one onely act of his will, all that which is created hath his beauty, and his being, and noe one leafe of any tree, can ſo much as wagg, but by his will? Infallibly this is ſuch a <hi>ioy, as noe eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor can ſuch an vnſpeakeable knowledge as this, euer enter into the hart of any man, but ſuch a one as enioyes and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee heere the loue which the Saints haue in heauen, ſpeaking according to the poorenes of our vnderſtanding. And from this aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſwelling <hi>Riuer, which delights the Citty of God,</hi> doth flow that <hi>loue</hi> which the ſoules in heauen beare to their <hi>neighbours.</hi> For as all the deſire and <hi>ioy</hi> of the Saints conſiſteth in their <hi>ſeeing God</hi> (who is their true <hi>loue</hi>) full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory; from hence they grow to <hi>loue,</hi> with a moſt feruent <hi>loue,</hi> and to deſire with an exceſſe of appetite, that all the Saints may be as full of glory, and beauty, as they alſoe are. And they <hi>ioy</hi> in this, to a ſtrange proportion, becauſe he is honoured, and glorified in them whoſe honour and glory, they onely ſeeke. And in reguard that this is the cauſe why they <hi>loue</hi> the Saints, from hence it growes, that they <hi>ioy</hi> more, and doe more deſire the glory, and beauty, of the greateſt Saints, then of their very ſelues, becauſe they ſee that our Bleſſed Lord, is more glorified in thoſe others, then in them. And by this tyme, you may perceiue how fart this holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany is, from <hi>ſelfe-loue,</hi> &amp; from <hi>enuy,</hi> which ſprings from that roote.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:15877:22"/>
               <p>But you will tell me perhapps, that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes from hence, that they will be ſubiect to ſome diſguſt, becauſe themſelues are not ſoe growne in ſanctity as others are, ſince thereby the glory of God would alſoe haue encreaſed in them. This doth not follow, conſidering that firſt effect of <hi>loue,</hi> which is the vnion of two <hi>wills</hi> in one; for they are transformed into the <hi>will</hi> of God, and would haue nothing done, but that which their lord <hi>will,</hi> and they ſee, that this will, is the cauſe why one hath more glory then another, and from hence they grow to be highly content, with that which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to them, as alſoe, becauſe the diuerſity of the degrees of glory, in the bleſſed, doth more beautify the whole Citty of God, then if they were all, of one rancke; as the muſick of a vyall, is much the ſweeter, becauſe it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſtrings, and diſtinct ſoundes, then if they were all, but any one. And ſince it is ſoe, that <hi>becauſe there are different degrees of glory and diuers manſions in the triumphant Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 13.</note> it is of greater beauty, then if they all poſſeſſed but one,<note place="margin">

For they in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and others in other colours of a deeper dye, doe all concurre, to manifeſt the infinite goodnes, and beauty of him, who made them.</p>

It now remaines that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you, the loue of your <hi>neighbour,</hi> which growes out of this other profound <hi>Loue.</hi> The <hi>loue,</hi> my good ſiſter, which you muſt carry to your neighbour muſt bee, by <hi>deſiring</hi> and <hi>louing</hi> all that <hi>good,</hi> which you ſee in him: becauſe thereby, our Lord God is glorified and adored. And the more that is, the greater muſt your ioy be; as on the other ſide, any offence or ſinne which you shall diſcouer in your neighbour muſt be abhorred by your ſoule, becauſe he is offended, whoſe honour and glory you deſire. And ſoe as I tould you that the loue of God conſiſted in our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15877:26"/>applauſe, and <hi>will,</hi> that our Lord ſhould be the very thing which he is; and that the <hi>ioye</hi> which is taken thereby is a particular guift of our Lord; ſoe alſo doth the loue of your <hi>neighbour</hi> conſiſt in the application of your <hi>will,</hi> to <hi>deſire</hi> the good of your <hi>neighbour,</hi> which is to reioyce in his true good, and to feele much griefe, for the ſinne which he committs.</p>
               <p>This is a very particular fauour of our Lord, which he beſtowes vpon whome he will. So that if you haue obſerued the matter well, you will haue ſeene, that the marke at which both the <hi>loue</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of our <hi>neighbour</hi> ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes is, that God may be glorified and adored. And heereby you will alſo perceiue how ſhort he falls of true <hi>loue,</hi> who greiues to ſee his neighbour growne vp apace, in deuotion, and vertue, conſidering that himſelfe is not ſo growne vp. For though it be true, that the true <hi>louer</hi> of our Lord, will not faile to carry a knife about him, which peirces him through at the very hart, becauſe he ſerues not our Lord ſo well as hee ought, and might; yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it not from hence, that, by ſeeing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruant of God <hi>thriue,</hi> faſter in ſpirit then himſelfe, he muſt therefore be ſorry for it or diſmayed by it. But rather, the eaſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is to ſerue you for a remedy againſt that much greife, which your ſoule receiues, becauſe your ſelfe doe not ſerue our Lord, ſoe well as you ſhould, muſt be to conſider, that though you (through your weakenes) doe not

               <p>But as for that other kinde of diſmay, to which ſome are ſubiect; I conceiue that it growes but from ſelfe-loue, for it is certaine, that if the end why a true louer of our Lord, deſires much to ſerue him be, that his God may be honoured, and glorified, (who is glorified, as well by the ſanctity, which is in the ſoule of another, as if it were in his owne) it followes, that he is to haue much <hi>ioy,</hi> to ſee that others goe increaſing in the ſeruice of our lord, though it be true on the other ſide, that he may be in paine, becauſe he ſerues him not ſoe well.</p>

               <p>I doe much reioyce, at the holy deſires which you haue to pleaſe our lord, but I am in pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to conſider your puſillanimitie, in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame.

Thou feareſt ſome little affront, which heere may threaten thee; but thou ſeekeſt for noe remedy, againſt that huge affront, which is reſerued and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the latter day, to all ſuch as shall not haue done honour to our Lord, with a liuely faith, and true obedience. Thou makeſt much account of thy ſelfe, and little of almightie God, for thou fulfilleſt thyne owne will, in diſpight of his. And any trifle which concernes thy ſelf, offends thee much; and the while, thou haſt noe care at all, of that which highly concernes the honour of God. Thou liueſt after thine owne fashion, that thou maiſt be wholly miſerable; and thou liueſt not as God would haue thee, whoe is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme felicity.</p>
               <p>One of theſe two things is infallibly true. Either that the light of the holy ghoſt, muſt be that which vrges &amp; enforces this blindnes vpon vs, which cannot be, or els, that the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is prouided for ſinne will, one day, open the eyes of ſuch deceiued perſons, when there will be noe remedy for their miſery. For as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>The eyes which ſinne shutts, paine opens.</hi> And therefore Sir, if you loue your ſoule, if you feare almightie God, if your hart be not of flint, looke carefully vpon the shortnes of this life, and how many you haue knowne, whoe being well accommodated and ſupported heere, God hath commaunded to goe hence, and that not with ſoe much contentment and ioy, as they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15877:33"/>would haue wiſhed, but complayning that the world had deceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that for loue thereof, they had neglected the ſeruice of our Lord. That which they were, wee are, &amp; where they be arriued, we ſhall arriue, and the ſame earth muſt receiue vs all, &amp; conuert vs all into it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For what therefore doe we ſtay? By what are wee deteyned? What is that, which decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vs, and makes vs ſoe profoundly careleſſe, of a buſines which ſoe highly imports? What makes vs thinke that it concernes vs little, notwithſtanding that noe other thing imports vs at all, in compariſon of this? And if wee ſhall confeſſe, that we hould it to be highly important, why then doe wee labour ſoe little for it? why doe wee ſpend ſoe few howers about it? Why doe we try ſoe few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions to obtaine it? why doe we aske ſoe little aduiſe, how we may contriue it: Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that any little fitt of tyme, which wee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy about this buſines, ſhould ſeeme ſoe great a matter, whereas yet wee neuer thinke much, and be neuer weary, how much ſoeuer tyme we ſpend vpon the buſines of this world? If any queſtion be moued, about expence to be made vpon ſome preſent occaſion of vanitie, how magnificent are we wont to ſhew our ſelues: but how miſerly, on the other ſide, in any thing which it concernes vs to doe for the honour of God, and the good of our neighbours. In that former caſe noe conſideration is had, either of children, or prouiſion otherwiſe for the howſe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15877:33"/>but all that, is laid aſide, for the reſpect which is had to ſome curioſity. But in the latter, ſuch a heape of conſiderations, &amp; reaſons are brought into diſcourſe, as ſerue to ſhutt the purſe, and to tye vp the hands from that good worke.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall I ſay of this other proofe of our frailty? Our whole life proclaimes with a loud voyce, that wee value the preſent world, more then the future; the exteriour, then the interiour; riches, then goodnes. For that thing doe we loue beſt, which we deſire moſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, when we want it, and which we labour to gett with moſt anxiety; &amp; wherein wee ioye moſt when wee haue it, and for which wee ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row moſt when wee looſe it. And if the caſe arriue, wherein we muſt looſe the one or the other, we put our good conſcience in hazard, for putting that in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the honour, or profitt or pleaſure of this world ſuggeſts.</p>
               <p>The day will come, and that quickly, when thoſe worldly perſons will finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtraungely diſappointed, and hauing loſt all their labours, and leauing the fruites heereof behind them they ſhall be preſented all naked and poore, and in the extremity of confuſion, before him, who ſent them hither, not to the end that they ſhould goe fooling after vanities, but that they might paſſe through theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, without ſtaying or ſetting their harts vpon them, and that hauing their bodyes heere vpon earth, their ſoules might be aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to heauenly things. And that though they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15877:34"/>liue in flesh; yet they should not liue according to the deſires thereof, and though they dwell in the world, yet not to haue the conditions of the world; but that like children who imitate their father, they might be pure and true, and pious, and humble, and meeke, and that they might ſeeke after the glory of God, &amp; the good of their neighbours.</p>
               <p>What will hee be able to doe at that day, who ſhall not haue performed the thing, for which he was ſent, into this world? what will he be able to doe, by whoſe thought it hath not ſoe much as paſſed, that he muſt once beginne to attend to it, but who forgetting the purity, and perfection of a chriſtian life, whereby hee was to imitate almighty God, hath defiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in the mudd of earth, and hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like ſome foolish boy, who, being ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout buſines, would needes ſtay to paſſe his tyme, and play with other boyes; or els loyter for ſeeing of ſome vaine show, and neither did that which he was commaunded, nor ſoe much as remembred where about, he went, till retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning home at night, without any anſweare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Your ladyſhip muſt not therefore be carryed away, by that great errour which yet is imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many great ones of this world, who are mightily affected to their owne will, and who abound with particular appetites, and who thinke belike, that they are to abound as much more then others, in deſire of things, as they are heere of more eminent ranke &amp; ſtate; but for my part I ſee not what they gather from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15877:37"/>hence, but greater torments. For after the rate of the deſire, is the paine. And as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let our proper will ceaſe, and there will noe more be any hell.</hi> And ſoe wee may ſay, let this proper will ceaſe, and there will not be in the world, either any ſinne or any ſorrow.

And therefore doth God require our harts of vs, that ſoe hee may free them from many miſeries, and may giue vs in exchaunge, his owne, which is peaceable, repoſed and Ioyfull in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. And a groſſe foole is hee, who had rather liue in his owne ſtraitnes, then in the latitude of Almightie God; and who had ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther dye in himſelfe, then liue, in life.

For by this meanes, God is wont to take away our ſinnes like one who ſhould take the boughes or branches of a tree, and ſetting them firſt on fire, ſhould apply them afterwards, to the tree it ſelfe, and ſoe burne it vpp, by the rootes.</p>

               <p>Who would not be amaſed, to behould a great rocky Mountaine hanging looſe in the ayre, without falling downe to his proper place; and who will not wonder to ſee a hart which was created to repoſe, and reſt in God, detaine it ſelfe, in the ayre, and leſſe then ayre?

               </argument>
               <p>IF you knew how great ioy I haue felt in my ſoule, by your letters, I beleeue you would write often to mee, how carefull ſoeuer the deuill might be, to diſcourage you. And if you knew how great fauour you doe mee, in letting me ſee, that you are c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ofident of my truth to you, and if withall you would be pleaſed to make tryall of mee, I beleeue you would caſt away a great number of thoſe imaginations, which the deuill brings to you, about the making you thinke, that you are troubleſome to mee. I, for my part, haue not taken vpon me ſo in ieſt, that charge of you, which our lord hath put into my hands, as that any difficulty could make me weary of it, how great ſoeuer it might bee; and how much leſſe can I bee weary, when the thing it ſelfe is not painefull to mee, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull. I beſeech you, for the loue of our lord, that you will aske him, whether I loue you or noe. For I hope for ſoe much fauour at his hands, as that he will tell you I doe, foraſmuch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15877:41"/>as he is a freind of truth, and hee knowes that the thing, indeede, is ſoe. Doe you not already vnderſtád, that this is but a tricke of the deuill, vnderſtád, that this is but a tricke of the deuill, whereby he would pull downe weake perſons? Doe you not know, how much hurt this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite doth to ſome of your neighbours, when they beleiue it? you know well enough, how to chide them, who will not conceiue, that they are beloued by their freinds, and how to take the part of ſuch as are abſent. But now why take you not that counſaile for your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, which you giue to others? why will you needes tire me out, with your incredulitie, as others doe? For the loue of him, who was crucified for vs, let not things paſſe in this manner; but be confident that our lord loues you, and imparts true loue to mee, for the doeing of all that, which is neceſſary for you; &amp; that this muſt laſt till you ſhall haue gayned the crowne, to which our lord hath called you: which is not to be any little one, nor doe I finde in my ſelfe, any little ioy, that I am hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you to gaine the ſame.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſoe forbeare, both to ſay, and thinke, that the ſtate wherein you are, is a ſtate of condemnation. For that is a meere temptation of the deuill, who deſires nothing more, then that you may leaue your manner of life, that ſoe, he may carry you away with him. And if it ſeeme to you, that you haue not that <hi>recollection,</hi> which you ought, for my part I am glad that you deſire it, and ſigh for it. But
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15877:42"/>yet you muſt not doe it ſoe, as withall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that you are not pleaſing to God, in doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what you doe. Many tymes men ſerue God more, whilſt they haue noe recollectió, (ſoe that yet withall, they procure it), then with hauing it. For ſometymes, yea and many tymes, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God is that, to the end wee may vſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to his children, we ſhall forſake the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of attending to himſelfe alone. And the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Iacob</hi> was enamoured of <hi>Rachell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 29</note> who was faire, &amp; he ſerued ſeauen yeares, that they might giue her to him, for his wife; and at the end the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, they gaue him <hi>Lia,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Rachell,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his liking. And when he complayned the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, they tould him, that it was not the fashion of that country, to beſtow their youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters firſt, as he deſired. But they wished him to marry this other at that tyme, and that if indee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de he loued the yonger as much as he ſaid, he should labour ſeauen years more for that, and then they would alſoe giue her to him, and this hee did, and ſoe he obteyned her.</p>
               <p>Hee who hath a minde to giue himſelfe, as it were, in marriage to the beautifull <hi>life of recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>deuout prayer,</hi> deſires that which is very good.

But in the meane tyme hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with vs, if we will ſigh for this, and if we

Neither is he in the right, who is gladd of buſines, and imployments; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet is that other in the right, whoe when he is in the middeſt thereof, goes ſtill complayning. But he alone complyes with that which God commands, whoe beſtowes his hands, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vpon the ſeruice of his neighbours; and his deſires vpon the ſeruice of our Lord, with more deſires vpon the ſeruice of our Lord, with more recollection.

But he muſt haue patience in his buſines; and in his deſire and loue, he muſt haue quietnes; his hands in one of them, and his eyes, vpon the other. He obeys in the one, and he ſues for the other.

               </p>
               <p>Our Lord therefore, who knowes ſoe much better, then our ſelues, what is good for vs, and ſees that the deſires of our hart ſome tymes are ſuch; as I haue ſaid, hath care to conduct our life, according to that which he iudges to import vs moſt.

For woe be to that ſoule, which preſumes to thinke, that he may conteſt with God, any other way, then by begging mercie.</p>
               <p>Know you, your ſelfe, for wicked, and God will wrapp you vp warme in the mantie of his goodnes, and mercic. And euery day, he will growe, in doeing you greater fauours.

And ſince both your father who is in heauen, and your ſpirituall father who is on earth, are contented, with you; you muſt alſoe be contented with your ſelfe. Not ſoe, as that you may giue ouer, to proceede, and profitt in the ſeruice of our lord, but that you may not be diſcouraged, or diſmayed, in the manner of life which now you hould. And dee you alſoe confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that our Lord is ſerued, by your aboade where you are; and this I declare to you, in his name; and that he will comfort you much, and vouchſafe to doe you very great fauours.

               <p>Now this being ſoe, I confeſſe you owe me not many thanks, for my wiſhing well to your ſoule; becauſe the good thereof is mine, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15877:47"/>that God hath done me the fauour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow you vpon me, for my ſpirituall childe, and will impart you to me as one of the pretious ſtones of that <hi>crowne,</hi> which one day he will vouchſafe mee, if I continue faithfull in that vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by which he hath called mee.

               <p>Madam, you muſt giue thankes to our lord; for hee treates you, as he hath treated, and as he meanes to treate his beſt freinds. And as for that <hi>onely begotten ſonne</hi> of his, who is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>ſtone</hi> of all <hi>ſtones,</hi> doe but ſee what blowes they gaue him.

He who knowes Chriſt and his kingdome, hath noe compaſſion of himſelfe, in this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knowes himſelfe to be more fitt for God, the more afflictions he endures for his ſake. And ſoe did that enamoured <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſay <hi>Fire, Croſſe, fury of beaſts, cutting, quartering, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and deſtroying of euery parte of my whole body, and the ſcourges of the deuill himſelfe; Let all theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15877:48"/>things come vpon mee, and lett me onely enioy Chriſt our lord. There is nothing in this world, which can doe me good; not ſoe much as euen a kingdome. It is more happines for me to dye for Chriſt our Lord, then to exerciſe dominion ouer the earth, from one end thereof to the other.</hi> This ſaith that <hi>Saint,</hi> as one who knew well and did much loue our lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and who ſaw that all was well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, which could be disburſed for the gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him.</p>
               <p>In this manner, I deſire that you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your ſelfe to ſuffer the <hi>Purgatorie</hi> of your ſinnes; yea and though you ſhould not haue committed ſinne, you ſhould yet apply your ſelfe to endure affliction, for the pure loue of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> whoe endured ſoe great things for you, without hauing giuen the leaſt ſhaddow of cauſe in himſelfe. And I would haue you ſay to him, that howſoeuer you are bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what he will ſend, yet out of a free hart, you would gladly ſuffer, for the pure loue of him, though you were not bound to it. And thus according to the intention of your hart, our Lord will accept it at your hands, as an <hi>Embleme</hi> which you carry for his loue. In the loues of this world men vſe to make other <hi>Emblemes;</hi> but in the <hi>loue</hi> of God, the <hi>Embleme,</hi> is <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in affliction.</hi> And he who is not of a ſtrong hart to <hi>ſuffer much,</hi> lett him neuer ſtand telling mee that he <hi>loues much.</hi> For in this world there is noe <hi>loue</hi> without <hi>greife.</hi> I hope in God, that as heere hee giues you <hi>greife,</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15877:49"/>trouble; ſoe hee hath prouided a place of reſt, and ioy for you, in the other world. Though indeede, the very <hi>ſuffering</hi> for ſuch a Lord, is reward enough. And ſoe that as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſoe much to be deſired, in the other world, as to enioy that kingdome with Chriſt our Lord, ſoe neither is there any thing in this, which may be compared to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>ſuffering</hi> with him, and for him. <hi>Suffer</hi> therefore with a good will, ſince you are to be crowned, for the ſame. For the afflictions which you endure, come to you but as a fitt meanes, whereby you may obtaine that <hi>crowne.</hi>

Lett vs greately feare the goeing backward in ſpiritt, of one onely day, &amp; lett vs not ſuffer a defect, though it may ſeeme ſmall, to paſſe away, without puniſhment. And I ſay <hi>though it ſeeme ſmall,</hi> for in very deede, none at all is ſoe, for the very leaſt of them doth vs much hurt, though ſome of them be greater then other.</p>
               <p>Lett vs reſolue that this miſcheife proceedes from one of theſe two cauſes; either not being <hi>thankefull</hi> for the good receiued, or being <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> in conſeruing it. Saint Bernard ſaith, That the cauſe why God imparting great benefitts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15877:52"/>to many, without euen ſoe much as their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, doth yet deny them other inferiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitts which they asked afterwards, is becauſe they were <hi>vngratefull</hi> for thoſe greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts; and thereby make themſelues vnworthy of the leſſer. Nor is it any new thing, that he who vſes ill the great bleſſing which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues (as if there were noe neede of taking pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to conſerue that which is already gotten) ſhould looſe them. Soe that we muſt now thanke God againe, for the benefitts which we haue receiued; and let vs employ them well, (forasmuch as now remaines in our power), leaſt wee vtterly looſe them all, and our ſelues with them. Lett vs be the more remiſſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſſes, that ſoe we may be attentiue to this, with all our power. When a man diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his eſtate, into very many parts and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it growes to be in effect nothing. And he who hath receiued particular bleſſings from heauen may content himſelfe with keeping them, and growing rich in them, though he be not ſo proſperous in the goods of this world. If he haue a minde to comply very punctually with the deſire of temporall riches, I feare that it will be vpon the price of ſomewhat els which is more worth. For <hi>the world is ſoe full of malignitie,</hi>

And if ſomewhat muſt needes be loſt, let it be that, which will one day be loſt, whether wee will or noe, how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refully ſoeuer we may thinke to keepe it.

And ſoe the fall of one, whome our lord hath rayſed, and placed vpon his feete, and giuen him light, wherewith to ſee; is more diſpleaſing to his diuine Maieſty; then they which he tooke, before they knew or loued God.

Auguſtine</hi> deſired two things of our Lord, ſaying, <hi>Graunt to mee, O Lord, that I may know thee, &amp; that I may know my ſelfe.</hi> Theſe two are things, which we muſt all deſire, and noe man is to be found without them, vnleſſe withall he deſire to be found without ſaluation. The <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Salomon</hi> conſiſted of two partes; Both of them were holy, but yet one of them, was more holy then the other. That parte which was leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was the way, to the other, which was more holy. The firſt is the <hi>knowledge of a man's ſelfe;</hi> which certainely is a holy thing; &amp; it is the way to that <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> which is the <hi>knowledge of God;</hi> where our Lord makes anſweare to our demaunds, and remedies our neceſſities; and where we finde the fountaine of life. For <hi>this,</hi> ſaith <hi>our Lord, is true life, that wee know thee, and whome thou haſt ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, this ſoe high thing, namely <hi>the knowledge of God,</hi> is not to be obtained, without
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15877:58"/>that other, which ſeemes ſoe lowe, namely the <hi>knowledge of ones ſelfe.</hi> It is moſt certaine, that noe man euer ſaw God, vnleſſe firſt he ſaw himſelfe. Nor is it ſafety for any man, to fly high, vnleſſe he haue the counterpoyſe of knowing himſelfe, which makes vs thinke baſely of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the other fauours of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour, there is noe doubt, but that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would be ſtanding to looke at him, with exceeding great guſt, whilſt he was aſcending vp to heauen vpon <hi>Aſcenſion day,</hi> ſince there was noe remedy, but that they muſt needes forgoe his conuerſation; that conuerſation which can carry noe diſguſt with it. And they found great comfort, in looking vpon the way by which he paſſed, and towards the place to which he went. But what did our lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them? Not certainely, that they ſhould be ſtill caſting vp their eyes to heauen, though that ſeemed to be an excellent thing; But he ſaid thus to them; <hi>You men of Galilee, why doe you ſtand looking vp to heauen?</hi> Giuing vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnderſtand, that although it be a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoury thing, to looke towards God, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes vs alſoe to ſtudy our ſelues. Firſt for the reuerence which wee owe to God vpon who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we cannot looke, but with great confuſion, conſidering how vnworthy we are thereof. And ſecondly, becauſe when a man forgetts himſelfe, he is inſtantly apt to become wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; &amp; not ſeeing his owne faultes, and frailty,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15877:58"/>he growes to looſe all holy feare and he proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues light, and giddy, like a ſhip which being without balliſt, looſes the ankar, when any tempeſt riſes, and the end thereof is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried hither &amp; thither, till at laſt it be brought to ſuffer wrack. I neuer ſaw any ſoule remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in ſafety, but by <hi>the knowledge of it ſelfe.</hi> Noe building can be ſure without deepe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that tyme is well imployed, which is ſpent vpon the reproofe of a man's owne ſoule. It is full of profitt, towards the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our faults, if we will examine them. What kinde of thing is a man who examines not, and knowes not himſelfe but a howſe without a window; but the ſonne of ſome widdow ill brought vp, who for want of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is growne wicked; but a meaſure, without all meaſure, and rule, and which the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore is a falſe meaſure. And finally, what is he but a man, whoe is indeede noe man? For he who conſiders not himſelfe, doth neither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe like a man, nor doth he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or poſſeſſe himſelfe; but why leſt he is able to tell many ſtoryes of other things, he can giue noe account of himſelfe, at all. Theſe are they; who hauing forgotten themſelues, take ſuch paines to vnderſtand the liues of others; and hauing ſhut vp their eyes to their owne defects, haue yet more then a hundred eyes open, which ſtand in continuall watch ouer the errour of other folkes. Theſe are they, who obſerue, and aggrauate the errours of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15877:59"/>their neighbours, and neglect their owne. For in regard thoſe errours of others are beheld by them, more continually, &amp; more cloſe at hand; they ſeeme greater to them, then their owne, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they neuer looke but from farre of; &amp; ſoe, how great ſoeuer they be in themſelues, they ſeeme little to them. From hence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that in their conuerſation, they are ſoe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, and ſoe rigourous; for iuſt after the rate of their hauing noe conſideration of their one infirmities, they haue noe compaſſion of others.</p>
               <p>I neuer yet ſaw man, who was curious in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of himſelfe, who would not alſoe, eaſily paſſe ouer the fault of another, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that man be, who is ſeuere againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he falls, giues ſtrong euidence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby it is proued that he conſiders not his owne defects. Soe that, if wee deſire to fly, from this ſoe daungerous kinde of blindenes, we muſt be ſure to view &amp; reuiew; what kinde of things our ſelues are, that ſoe when we finde how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable we be, we may cry out for remedy, to our lord <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Becauſe indeede, hee is <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that is to ſay a Sauiour; but yet of noe other, then ſuch as know, and bewaile their owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and who receiue (<hi>indeede,</hi> if they can; and, in <hi>deſire,</hi> if they cannot) the holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that ſoe they may be cured and ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued. And although for the making vs <hi>know our ſelues,</hi> God, and his Saints, haue declared, many and many things to vs, yet he whoe ſhall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15877:59"/>attentiuely behould that which he may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to paſſe within his owne hart, will finde ſoe many things for which he muſt deſpiſe him ſelfe, that, with horrour, he will cry out, from the bottome of that Abiſſe, and ſay, <hi>there is noe end of my miſeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who is he that hath not erred, in thoſe things wherein he thought him ſelfe moſt ſure? who hath not deſired, &amp; ſearched after things, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that they were good for him; which yet afterward, he found to be full of preiudice? Who will preſume to know any thing, ſince he hath beene deceiued innumerable tymes? what thing is more blinde, then a man, who knowes not ſoe much, as what he is to aske of God, as <hi>S.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not ſoe much as what is good, for our ſelues, as it happened euen to the ſame <hi>S. Paule.</hi> Who begging of God, that he would free him from a particular temptation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he had asked a right; but it was giuen him to be vnderſtood, that indeede he knew not what he asked, nor ſoe much as what was good for him. And now who will put co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in his ability, to know euen ſoe much as what he ſhould Iudge, &amp; deſire, concerning himſelfe, ſince he, whome the <hi>holy ghoſt</hi> inhabited, did aske that, which was not good for him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Certainely, our ignorance muſt needes be very great, fince we erre ſoe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe things, wherein it imports vs ſoe much not to erre.</p>
               <p>But now though ſometymes, our lord ſhould
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15877:60"/>teach vs to know what is good, yet who doth not ſee, how very great our weakenes is; and how we fall flat vpon our faces, in thoſe things, wherein it concerned vs to ſtand vp right. To whome hath it not occurred many tymes, to propound the doeing of ſome good thing, and yet to finde himſelfe ouerthrowne, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by that wherein he tooke himſelfe to be moſt inuincible. To day wee lament our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with teares in our eyes, and we purpoſe to refraine them afterward, and yet, euen whilſt the ſame teares are ſtill wett vpon our cheekes; ſome new occaſion of ſinne is offered, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping becauſe we fell, we committ that very thing, for which we may haue cauſe to weepe againe; receiuing the body of our lord <hi>Ieſus-Chriſt,</hi> with much cauſe of being confounded, for the irreuerence which we haue committed. For the tyme hauing beene but ſhort, ſince we harboured his pretious body in our boſomes, it happens ſometymes, that by ſome ſinne, we driue his grace out of our ſoules. What care is ſoe weake, and light, which chaunges ſoe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, vpon the warning of all windes, as wee? Sometymes merry and ſometymes ſadd; now deuout, and then diſtracted; now full of deſire tending to heauen, and then following the world, and euen dropping downe to hell. Now hee abhorres a thing, and inſtantly he loues that, which he abhorred. He caſts vp that which he had eaten, becauſe he found it charge his ſtomack, and preſently he eates it vp againe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15877:60"/>as if he had not caſt it before. What thing can there be, with ſuch variety of coulours in it, as a man who is made after this ſort? what Image can they painte with ſoe many faces, and ſoe many tongues, as this kinde of man?

I doe not thinke that there could be a more hedious thing, then if we were able to diſcerne to how many ſeuerall diſpoſitions one man is ſubiect, in one onely day. His whole life is a very maſſe of mutability, and frailty. And that, which the ſcripture ſaith, agrees well to him,<note place="margin">

And if wee conſider, vpon how large accompts wee ſtand obliged to almighty God, for the tyme paſt; and how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15877:61"/>little amendment there is in the tyme preſent, we will be ſure to ſay, and we may doe it with much truth. <hi>The ſorrowes of death haue enuironed mee, the dangers of hell haue hemmed me in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O danger of hell, which is ſoe mightily to be feared! And who is not hee, that will not watch with a hundred thowſand eyes, that he may not be put to welter in that profound Lake; where hee ſhall eternally bewaile the temporall delight, which he hath vnlawfully enioyed? who will not take care of his way, leaſt otherwiſe he be found wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering from all happines? where are the eyes of that man, who ſees not this? where are his eares, whoe heares not this? where is his pallate who taſtes not this? It is a cleare teſtimony of death, not to performe the actions of life. Our ſinnes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, our frailties are great, our enemies are ſtout, crafty, and many; and they hate vs home. That whereof wee are in queſtion, is either the gayning or looſing of God, for all eternity. How comes it then to paſſe, that in the middeſt of ſoe many dangers, we can eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me our ſelues ſecure; and vnder the weight of ſoe many woundes, we doe not feele the paine thereof? why ſeeke we not for ſome remedy, before the night ſteale vpon vs, and before the gates of all ſuccour, be ſhutt vp againſt vs? when thoſe fooliſh virgins ſhall cry out,<note place="margin">Matth 25. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>11.</hi>

When my betters doe me a disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour which I feele much, I muſt thinke that my inferiours will be troubled after the ſame manner, if I disfauour them.

               <p>Now becauſe we conſider not this, there are very few whoe finde themſelues entertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; by almighty God with ſweetenes; and there are many who complaine, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getts to releiue their miſeries; and they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile how hee can ſend them ſuch ſtore of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, both within, and without; eſpecially ſince his very name, is, <hi>Mercifull, and the shewer of mercies;</hi> and ſince he inuites men to ſeeke for ſuccour at his hands.

Let them complaine in themſelues, in that they haue noe charity with their neighbours. For God, is full of Charitie, for his parte; but it is not reaſon, nor will hee exerciſe it, towards ſuch, as are wanting in it to their neighbours. And if at any tyme he impart temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, to ſuch a one as is vncharitable towards others, what good will thoſe bleſſings doe that wicked man, if withall he looſe himſelfe. But God will not giue him any ſuch thing, as may make him indeede the better by it, but vpon condition that he carry himſelfe as he ought towards his neighbours.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore <hi>know our ſelues,</hi> and lett vs be towards others, as we deſire, they ſhould be towards vs; and ſoe let vs paſſe on towards the knowledge of God, and from the <hi>Sancta</hi> to the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum.</hi> And lett vs lift vp our eyes to our Lord, whoe was placed vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> for our ſaluation, and in him wee ſhall diſcerne, both more, &amp; greater bleſſings, then wee diſcouered miſeries in our ſelues.

For thou to honour vs, didſt endure ſoe great diſhonour, that as wee are wont to ſay of ſome very baſe vnworthy man, that he diſhonours his whole ſtocke, ſoe did they alſoe ſay of thee, <hi>that thou disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouredſt the whole race of mankinde.</hi> Bee thou Bleſſed without end. For all the honour, which all the race of mankinde poſſeſſes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes from thee, and through thee. Thou gaueſt it by the coniunction of thy ſelfe to them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy ſelfe man, and dying for men and exalting them to an equallity with <hi>Angells,</hi> and euen with <hi>Seraphins,</hi> if themſelues will; and ordeyning, that the ſonnes of ſinnefull <hi>Adam,</hi> they may become the <hi>ſonnes of God.</hi> and the <hi>heyres of thy Father,</hi> and <hi>coheyres with thee;</hi> as being thy bretheren, and yet thou; O Lord, art called <hi>the dishonour, and abaſement of the people.</hi> Thou didſt abaſe thy ſelfe O Lord to exalt vs; thou didſt abaſe thy ſelfe belowe all men, that thou mighteſt rayſe vs, about the Angells.</p>
               <p>What shall wee render to thee O Lord,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15877:65"/>for ſoe great fauours; but onely that we muſt tenderly, and profoundly knowe, that if wee haue any thing, if wee be fitt for any thing, and if we be any way acceptable to almighty God, it is wholly by thee; And wee muſt yeild thee all thankes, and praiſe, for that thou being what thou art, wouldeſt yet vouchſafe to offer thy ſelfe to ſufferance of ſoe great afflictions, for ſuch wretched things, as wee are. Thou diminiſhedſt thy ſelfe in that <hi>little hill,</hi> that thou mighteſt exalt vs to that great hill.

And by the <hi>malediction</hi> which fell vpon thee the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, thou diddeſt purchaſſe, and thou wilt impart to vs that happy benediction of thine. <hi>Come you bleſſed of my father, poſſeſſe, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is prepared for you.</hi> They curſed thee, O Lord, and thou bleſſedſt vs. Thy death giues vs life, and thy affliction, eaſe; Since thou wert content to be <hi>iudged,</hi> it is reaſon that thou alſoe be our <hi>Iudge.</hi> Lett vs therefore reioyce ſince hee who loues vs ſoe much, is to be our <hi>Iudge;</hi> and wee will goe confidently to <hi>iudgment,</hi> ſince the Iudge is of our owne flesh and bloud.</p>

Let vs caſt our ſelues downe at his feete, deteſting our ſinnes, and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wicked life; diſtruſting our owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and worth, and ſtrength; and ſo, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering to beg, to knock, and to cry out, he will fill vs with knowledge; how to addreſſe our ſelues, and with power to worke; and with perſeuerance, that wee may not fainte as it is written,<note place="margin">

               <p>This my lord, ſeemed ſufficient to me, for the addreſſe of a perſon who hath a minde to draw neere to God. But becauſe in your lordſhip, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is the capacity of two perſons, your lordſhip
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15877:67"/>will haue neede of two rules. That which is ſaid, may ſuffice forasmuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes your owne particular perſon; but in reſpect that you are a man, who haue ſoe great charge ouer ſoe many others; it wil be neceſſary for you, to haue more &amp; more care of your ſelfe. For there are many, who for as much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes their owne particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, are good men; &amp; yet they faile in being good Lords, &amp; good Magiſtrats. And this ſecond parte is more hard, and it is the worke of one who is a kinde of perfect man; for it takes that firſt kind of goodnes for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then paſſes further on. For hee whoe forasmuch as concernes himſelfe, is not Iuſt, will not be Iuſt in what he ought to doe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. But yet it ſuffices not for one who hath charge ouer many, that hee be <hi>Iuſt,</hi> for as much as concernes onely his owne particular perſon. <hi>Ely.</hi> for his owne part was a good man, but he was not good for as much as concerned his ſonnes, ſince he for boreto puniſh them; &amp; therefore he was greiuously puniſhed by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. So that, great lords haue neede of a manyfold kinde of goodnes, ſince they haue a manifold kinde of perſon.</p>
               <p>As for this ſecond part, which to be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon or publique perſon, me thinkes there is noe better glaſſe, wherein a man who is a lord ouer others, ought to looke, then vpon that lord of men and angells, whoſe perſon he repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Hee who ſitts in the place of another, it is but reaſon that he haue the properties
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15877:68"/>of him, whoſe place he holds. A lord of vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes is a Lieutenant of God who ordaines, that ſome ſhall gouerne and commaund, and that others ſhall obey. He <hi>who reſiſts thoſe</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, doth by the teſtimony of S. <hi>Paule, reſiſt ſhe ordination of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> who diſpoſes of all things according to ſubordination.</p>
               <p>Now therefore lett a man conſider, what office God exerciſes towards man; and ſoe a great lord ſhall know how hee is to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towards his people. God chaſtiſes ſuch as erre, without any acceptation of perſons, and in this he is ſoe ſtrict, that he hath not any, who is ſo great a fauourit of his, but that he ſhall pay ſoundly for it, if he giue iuſt cauſe. Nay he pardoned not ſoe much as his owne ſonne, though hee owne nothing for himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, but onely becauſe he obliged himſelfe, to pay for the ſinnes of others. Without faile he muſt needes be farre from acceptation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoe puniſhed with ſoe great ſeuerity, his onely begotten ſonne, and ſuch a ſonne, and ſoe deerely beloued, and that for the ſinnes of others. There is nothing which ſhould haue power, to make him who gouernes, forbeare the doeing of his duty; but he is to ſtand like the ſtalke of a balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which leanes not, either to the one ſcale or to the other, that ſo cuery man may haue his owne. There is noe ſtate but it would periſh and be vndone, if publique bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſhould be ledd, after the pace of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affections. And at an inſtant doth that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15877:68"/>leaue to be <hi>publique,</hi> when he hangs neuer ſoe little towards the <hi>particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince the reſpect of priuate profitt, muſt not bend him who gouernes, much leſſe muſt the reſpect of any other man's profitt make him bend, ſince he owes more to himſelfe then to any other. Chriſt our Lord is the patterne which is made for all; not onely foraſmuch as concernes the priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of a particular man, but foraſmuch alſoe as concernes any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique perſon. For hee was a king and ſoe he is, though not after the manner of this world. But being in the chaire of his <hi>Croſſe,</hi> hee ſaid to his mother, <hi>Woeman behould thy ſonne.</hi> To giue vs to vnderſtand that hee who is in the place of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique perſon, muſt renounce all particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, though it ſhould regard his very <hi>Mother.</hi> And the ſame example, he alſoe gaue vs, when at ſome other tymes, he would ſpeak with leſſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dernes to that Bleſſed Mother of his. To teach vs how carefull wee muſt bee, to keepe our ſelues cleere from particular affection, though ſome be angry at it, and though our ſelues endure paine by it, rather then to cheriſh them, with diſguſt to God.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, to which great lords ought to attend ſo much (that ſo they may be well, both with God and man) as truly, &amp; cordially, (and like men who liue in the preſence of God) to remaine euer faithfull, &amp; firme to him, with out hanging either to this way, or to that. And this will be eaſily performed by that great man,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15877:69"/>who ſhall attentiuely conſider, that he is but the Miniſter of God; as one who but meerely executes, and muſt not exceede the commiſſion which is giuen to him. God places not great. Lords in the world, to the end that they may doe, and vndoe, what they liſt; but to execute the lawes of his holy will. And though they may account themſelues lords, yet are they ſtill vnder the vniuerſall Lord of all, in compariſon of whome, they are more truly vaſſailes, then their vaſſailes are theirs, and their power is as truly limitted as their vaſſailes power is foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as concernes the diſpenſing with what they ought to doe. Soe that he is to be more fauoured, and beloued, who hath moſt right on his ſide, and he is to be moſt puniſhed, who deſerues it moſt. And thus may any lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the true lord of all, if without accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons, he giue to euery one according to his workes; yea and if ſometymes he puniſh moſt, ſuch as are moſt fauoured by him. Both becauſe reaſon would require, that they ſhould offend him leaſt; and for that alſoe they muſt not thinke that becauſe they are beloued by him, they may take occaſion to doe what they liſt, &amp; that which reaſon alloweth not. Freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould laſt as long as vertue doth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, or oppoſition, as vice; For if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>woe be to ihem, who call good, euill, &amp; euill, good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your lordſhip muſt conſider beſides, that God hath placed you, in the eyes of many;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15877:69"/>whoe take that to be a rule of their liues, which they ſee you doe. Make account that you are ſeated in a high place, and that your ſpeech and faſhions are ſeene by all, and followed by the moſt part of men. If ſuch a faſhion be taken vp in Court, if ſuch a manner of ſpeach be vſed there, all men procure to follow it. And if it were the cuſtome amongſt great lords, that when one should giue them a buffet vpon one cheeke, they would tender the other, and if it were the faſhion for thim, to abhorre ſinne, and to take it for a point of greatenes, to obey the lawes of Chriſt our Lord, without doubt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour men would hould it an honour, to doe that which they ſaw practiſed by great perſons. And for this reaſon, I beleeue, that the Prelats of the Church, and the lords of the world, are a cauſe of perdition, to the moſt part of ſoules.</p>
               <p>I beſeech your lordſhip, that as you are a particular man, you will looke into your ſelfe with a hundred eyes, and that, you will looke into your ſelfe, with a hundred thowſand, as you are a perſon, vpon whome many looke, and whome many follow. And take care, to carry both your perſon, and your houſe, ſoe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the law of Chriſt requires; that hee who shall imitate your lordship, may alſoe imitate Chriſt our Lord therein, and may meete with nothing to ſtumble at. The vulgar, is without doubt, but a kinde of ape. Let great men conſider what they doe, for in fine that will be followed, either to their ſaluation, if
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15877:70"/>they giue good Example, or for their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it be euill. And this conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone should ſuffice to make great lords liue like ſoe many Saints, though it might coſt them ſome trouble; conſidering how our lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the ſonne of God, would not be a king, but reſolued by his labour and ſweat, to giue reſt, and peace to his ſubiects. And he fledd from proſperities and honours, leaſt otherwiſe, he might haue giuen occaſion of ſinne to his ſeruants, who would haue thought, (if Chriſt our lord had followed them) that is would alſo haue beene their part, to purſue the ſame. All things are to be thought little worth, ſo that we may procure thereby, that God be ſerued. And let this be the finall concluſion; That ſoe much the more attentiuely, a man shall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and imitate <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt, ſo much the better <hi>man,</hi> and ſo much the better <hi>Lord</hi> he ſhall bee. For in him wee beganne, and ſoe alſo we will end in him.</p>

               <p>O my ſoule come hither, and tell mee, for I aske thee on the part of God, what, in fine, is that thing, which detaines thee, from goeing all, with all thy forces, after God? What doeſt thou loue, if thou doe not loue this Spouſe of thine? Or rather why doeſt thou not loue him much, who did ſoe mightily loue thee? He had noe buſines on earth, but to attend to the loue of thee, and to ſeeke thy profitt, with his owne loſſe. And what haſt thou to doe in this world, but to exerciſe thy ſelfe, all, in loue of this king of heauen? Doeſt thou not ſee, how all that which heere thou ſeeſt, muſt haue an end, as alſo all that which thou heareſt, which thou toucheſt, which thou taſteſt, and wherewith thou doeſt converſe? Doeſt thou not ſee, that all this is but cobwebs, which cannot cloath thee, and keepe thee warme? Where art thou if thou haue not thy being in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our lord? what art thou thinking? what account art thou
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15877:72"/>making? what doeſt thou ſeeke, out of that onely, one, complete God?</p>
               <p>Let vs rowſe vp our ſelues at laſt, &amp; breake of this badd ſleepe; Let vs awake, for it <hi>is broad day,</hi> ſince <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our lord who is the light, is come. <hi>Let vs doe the wookes of light,</hi> ſince there was tyme wherein wee did the workes of darknes. O that the memory of that tyme, wherein wee know not God, might ſèrue vs now for sharp ſpurrs, to make vs runne gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily after him. O that we could runne, O that wee could fly, O that wee might burne, and be transformed, into him. What muſt a creature doe, when he ſees his creator made man, and all for loue of him alone? who euer heard of ſuch a loue as this, that one louing another, ſhould by loue be converted into that other. It is true that God loued vs, when hee made vs after his Image; but a farre greater worke it was to make himſelfe after our image. He abaſes himſelfe to vs, that hee may exalt vs to him. He makes himſelfe man, that hee may make vs Gods.

And now ſhall it be poſſible that in the midſt of theſe things, I ſhould lye ſleeping and without any ſenſe of gratitude for ſoe great loue? <hi>O lord illuminate myne eyes, that they may not ſleepe in ſuch a death as this</hi> And thou who haſt done vs this great fauour,<note place="margin">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15877:73"/>doe vs in the end.</p>
               <p>O Lord open thou myne eyes, that they may conſider thee, deſcending out of the boſome of thy father; and entring into that of thy <hi>virgin mother,</hi> that I may giue thee great thankes for this benefit. Make mee able to humble my ſelfe for thee. Make mee able to conſider thee lying in a maunger, inſteade of a bed, crying out, through could &amp; being oppreſt with pouerty; &amp; make me learne thereby, how to caſt all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy farre from mee.

And doe not thou permitt, that God ſhould weepe, and that man ſhould haue noe feeling of it; for I know not at which of theſe two things, wee might wonder moſt.</p>
               <p>Seale vp, O lord, thy wordes in my ſoule, that I may neuer ſinne againſt thee. Let the blood which thou didſt ſhed for mee, be gathered vp into my hart, and be thou all, my onely loue, that ſoe thou maiſt not repent thy ſelfe, of all theſe great afflictions, which thou enduredſt for mee. It is I, whom thou ſoughtſt, and whome thou ſeekeſt ſtill; and for mee thou haſt made all thoſe tiltings, and triumphes, and shewed forth all thy liueries, and vndergone all that coſt. Let me neuer ſee my ſelfe belonging to any other then thee, ſince thou haſt deſerued me ſoe well.</p>
               <p>Come Madam, let that hart of yours, now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15877:73"/>it ſelfe for God is vpon the point of being borne; and hee hath neither howſe, nor bedd, wherein to lye. Let your hart be all inflamed with loue, for the Infant ſuffers much cold. And yet if your hart be but euen ſoe much as luke warme this Infant with his cold, will giue it greater heat. For how much the more cold he ſuffers for vs, ſo much the more loue, he ſhewes to beare vs; &amp; where I finde my ſelfe to be more beloued, there am I obliged more to loue.</p>
               <p>Exteriourly hee ſuffers cold, and yet, through the great loue he beares vs, he can endure noe cloathes; but he lyes naked as ſoone as he is borne, &amp; naked they lay him vpon the Croſſe, becauſe in his bearth, &amp; in his death, he ſhewed the greateſt exceſſe of loue.</p>
               <p>Madam, you muſt prouide a cradle wherein you may rock him a ſleepe, which ſignifies the repoſe of contemplation, and ſee that you tend, and treat him well, for he is the ſonne of a great high king, and he is the ſonne alſoe of a virgin, and he takes much guſt to lodge himſelfe in the hart of virgins; for the meat he eates is fleſh, which is crucified &amp; dead. And becauſe he hath a great deale of poore people, amongſt his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whome yet he loues deerely well, you muſt be alſoe ſure to loue them, for they are the brethren of our creators. As ſoone as he is borne in your hart, you muſt take care to nurſe him; and I beſeech him to keepe and ſaue you, for his mercies ſake. Amen.</p>

               <p>THE grace and peace of the holy ghoſt, be in your hart, and aſſiſt you in this holy tyme; that you may prepare your ſoule, for that Infant who is now to be borne.

He comes in humility, and pouertie; and they who receiue him muſt be humble, and poore. He comes to vndertake great labours, and with labour that howſe muſt be adorned, wherein he voutcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes to dwell. He is chaſt, and he loues ſuch as are chaſt. And though he be very little, and a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15877:74"/>very Infant; yet withall, he is very great, and he is God; and ſoe it muſt be no little thing to prepare a lodging for a great God. Our lord is choiſe and nice, and by reaſon of ſome-one mortall ſinne which ſome man makes litle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to committ, he refuſes to enter into the ſoule. And if he be there already, one mortall ſinne, ſends him away. And when he is gone, he comes not back againe ſoe ſoone; but makes it plaine, by the difficulty which he hath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, with how great diligence he is to be kept, by vs; when we haue him there.</p>

               <head>A Letter of the Authour to a Lady, at the Feaſt of the Epiphany or three kings.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein hee shewes how shee is to goe and adore the Infant Ieſus; with thoſe kings; being guided by the ſtarre of faith; and that shee is to offer him the gould of diuine loue.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Wrote to your Ladyſhip this laſt Aduent, of the great fauour which our Lord did vs, in vouchſafing to come to vs, and of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that ſoule which diſpoſes himſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. I hope in his mercy, that hee is come home to you; and that you haue receiued him with faith and loue. And therefore now, there remaines noe more, but that you offer your ſelfe, in perpetuall ſacrifice to him, who hath vouchſafed to offer himſelfe to you as a deere gueſt, and that you imitate the faith and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents which were made by thoſe <hi>wiſe men</hi> to the Bleſſed Infant as ſoone as they found him out; as you haue already imitated them in the care they had to finde him. It will doe well, that you contemplate how this great lord is ſoe humbled, in that poore open ſtable, and that maunger, where the naturall diſcourſe and humaine reaſon of thoſe kings, was farre from thinking that they ſhould finde him. But the ſtarre which, with vs, is Faith, refuſes expreſly to paſſe any further on, and declares with moſt reſplendent beames as by ſoe many tongues,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15877:78"/>that hee who is aboue all reaſon, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, lyes in a place which is hidden from all diſcourſe of reaſon; that ſoe wee may learne to belceue, that moſt firmely, whereof wee finde leaſt certainty.</p>
               <p>For if as the ſtarre guided them, ſoe they had beene guided but by their reaſon, they would haue gone to looke for this new borne king in ſome royall pallace; for a perſon and a place wherein he dwells, are to carry proportion to one another: Our lord vouchſafes to ſhew a great fauour to them, vpon whom he beſtowes a ſtarre, which is the guift of faith; that ſoe they may ſeeke God, both when he is wrapped vp aſwell in thoſe ſwadling-cloutes, in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of his birth, as in the contempt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the death of the Croſſe; the kings finde him in one of thofe places, and the good theefe in the other. For both they, and hee, had the eyes of Faith, and that made them proſtrate themſelues all along and adore him, proteſting that they were as nothing in his diuine preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. For if they had knowne him but for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall king, how great ſoeuer hee had beene, it would haue ſuffized for them, to haue done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to him, as one man vſes to another; but for ſoe great men to proſtrate themſelues, before an Infant, betokens that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour faith, whereby they knew the high Maieſty, which lay hidd in that Infancy.</p>
               <p>But now your Ladyſhip muſt be ſure, that you appeare not empty before this Lord, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15877:78"/>that you thinke not that you giue him any thing, if you doe not giue him your loue. Nothing but God is able to make your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp happy; and nothing but your ſelfe is able to keepe him contented. This loue of his is not ioyned with any intereſt which regards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or the value of the preſents which are made to him; but it is a true and perfect loue, which requires an vnion of harts. And this is that language, as S. Bernard ſaith, whereby God, and the ſoule communicate themſelues &amp; ſpeake to one another, in the ſame tune. If our lord threaten and puniſh mee, I am not to doe the ſame; but my duty will bee, to humble my ſelfe ſoe much the more, as hee doth more exalt himſelfe; but if he loue mee, I muſt bee like him in that, and I muſt loue him, ſaying, with the ſpouſe; <hi>My beloued to mee and I to him.</hi>

Offer your loue to him; whoe for loue of you, did, though hee were ſoe great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an infant, and being God became man; and ſhedd the blood of circumciſion for you, within eyght dayes; as being not content that he had ſhedd teares, for you, when he was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.

               <p>Bee very carefull of your ſelfe in this buſines, and ſoe that you offer <hi>gould</hi> to the Infant <hi>Ieſus;</hi> For as a little gould is more worth then a great quantitie of other mettall, ſoe a little true loue, is more pretious, then much copper, and ſuch other mettalls of feare, and proper intereſt, or any other ſucch affects as riſe from theſe. Many are wont to meaſure themſelues by their doeing many good workes, and they neuer conſider that God reſpects nothing in them, but onely the hart from whence they riſe; and that one man ſhall pleaſe God more who doth leſſe good workes, then another whoe doth greater, if he who did the leſſe, haue the greater loue. Some man by faſting from ſome one meale, or by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome very little almes, ſhall be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to our lord (as the widdow was,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 12.</note> then many others whoe gaue great almes) becauſe he doth it with more loue then they. And heerein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares the greatenes of our Lord, ſince noeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which wee can doe him, how great ſoeuer it may be, is great in his ſight, if the loue of the partie be not great. For hee whoe hath neede of nothing, and cannot poſſibly encreaſe at all in riches, or any other good, why ſhould he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15877:79"/>care for ought which can be giuen him, but onely to be beloued, which is ſoe acceptable a preſent, as cannot be refuſed by any. And ſoe much is God in earneſt when he requires it of vs, as that he puniſhes with eternall death, the perſon whoe grauntes him not his loue.</p>
               <p>What thing is ſoe farre from ſelfe loue in the deſires of any thing, as hee whoe needes noe ſeruice which can be done him thereby; and whoe againe hath ſoe much deſire of any thing as he whoe ſoe requires a man's loue, as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with the torments of hell, who will not giue him that loue and giue it truely, yea, and that ſoe as it may exceede all other loues. And therefore Saint Auguſtine might ſay with reaſon, <hi>O lord what account doeſt thou make of mee, ſince thou commaundeſt, mee to loue thee; and doeſt threaten mee with huge miſeries if I loue thee not.</hi> Let his be therefore your prime care, to attend to the loue of our Lord. For this very purpoſe, he made himſelfe ſoe very little. For by how much the more he conceales, and as it were diſſembles his Maieſty, ſoe much more doth he declare his goodnes, and thus doth he the more inuite our loue; which lookes more at eaſe vpon the littlenes which he tooke, the vpon the greatnes which he naturally poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>His wiſedome lyes hidden by his being made an Infant whoe could not ſpeake. His power is alſoe bound vp by certaine ſwathing-cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and he endures bitter colde. And all this to the end, that the more of his other attributes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15877:80"/>he hides from vs, the more he may declare his loue to vs; that ſoe we alſoe may loue him the more, as we finde him to haue ſuffered more for vs. It is certaine that to ſee him tremble with colde doth kindle vs much more, then if wee ſaw him well, and warmely cladd, and if he felt noe paine. And therefore hee ſhall doe very ill, whoe denyes him his loue, ſince it was bought at ſoe much coſt of this Infant; and after the rate thereof, will it coſt that man whoe ſhall deny to giue it.</p>

               <p>You know already, that there are different complexions of mens bodyes; and ſoe is there variety of inclinations, in their mindes, yea and ſoe alſoe are the guifts which God imparts to men, very different.

But this

               <p>My meaning is, that it is one thing for a man to haue what to ſay to the king; and it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to know (which may be done with ſcilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) how to ſtand in his preſence, and there to carry himſelf as he ought. And this is that vnion of the ſoule with our lord, which a man shall doe well to procure during the tyme of <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and to hang wholly vpon him, iuſt ſoe as when he is in his Cell, vnited with our lord, in the moſt ſecret retired corner of his hart. And this, in ſuch ſort, as that the <hi>wordes</hi> which he reades, may not be of any diſtraction to this <hi>vnion;</hi> for he shall reape more fruite by it, then by them; though yet, it be true, that he is to haue regard alſoe to the <hi>wordes;</hi> but he is to accuſtome him ſelfe whileſt he hath his hart vnited, and preſent with God, to carry that attention withall, to what he doth, and ſaith, as is conuenient.</p>
               <p>Deere lord, and what doth the ſoule of that man feele, when hee carryes him in his hands who made election of our <hi>B. Lady,</hi> &amp; enriched her with celeſtiall graces, that she might be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15877:87"/>made fitt to liue and conuerſe with God made man. And when he compares her hands, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and eyes, with his owne, what confuſion doth he grow to haue? How ſtraightly will he hould himſelfe to be obliged, for ſuch a benefit? what caution will he vſe that he may keepe him ſelfe wholly for him, whoe hath done him ſoe much honour, as to put himſelfe into his hands, and to come to them by them wordes of <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, theſe things are noe bare wordes nor noe dead conſiderations; but they be arrowes, shutt ſtiffly out, from the ſtrong bowe of Almighty God, which wound and wholly chaunge the hart, and which make it deſire, that at the end of <hi>Maſſe,</hi> it may at lardge conſider that worde of our Lord, <hi>Scitis quid fecerim vobis?</hi>

And his ioy and life would conſiſt, in pondering, <hi>Quid fecerit ei dominus, what our lord had done for him,</hi> till the next day, that he should retourne to ſay <hi>Maſſe.</hi> And if our Lord doe at any tyme giue you this light, you will know what ſorrow and shame

And if you ſhall enter into the moſt inward corner of the hart of our Lord, and if hee vouchſafe to teach you, that the cauſe of his coming, is a violent and impatient kinde of loue, which permitts not him whoe loues, to be abſent from the party beloued; your ſoule will euen faint vnder ſuch a conſideration as that.</p>

               <p>I Haue deferred to write to you, out of a beleefe, that my letter would be of little power, towards the mitigating of that great ſorrow, to which they ſaid, you were growen ſubiect. And I thought I ſhould take a better courſe to be vttering my ſelfe to our Lord who is the Lord of all comfort, and to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending you to him, then to be ſpeaking to you, by my letters. But yet becauſe they haue beene demaunded with ſoe great inſtance, which ſerues to aſſure mee, how much they are deſired, and becauſe our lord hath power enough to doe what he liſts by the meanes euen of dead letters, I would not faile to doe as I was commaunded, and that to which I was obliged, beſeeching our lord that by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof he will be pleaſed to breede that comfort in your hart which I deſire.</p>
               <p>Our Lord hath ſoe diſpoſed, as to haue you try what taſt theſe afflictions haue, which are gathered in this vale of teares, and they not of the gentler but ruder ſort. Let his name

And what are all the yeares of our life, but a ſhort ſleepe, out of which when wee awake, wee finde our ſelues but to haue beene abuſed.

               <p>If then, wee finde ſoe great in conſtancy in this why doe wee not ſeeke that other? And ſince wee ſee every day, that this is ſlipping out of our hands; why doe wee not ſeeke that which laſts indeede, and will make our felicity

And if proſperitie did once tell vs, that there was ſomewhat heere, which might content vs, let now the gall of tribulation be applyed to our eyes and giue vs light to ſee, that, in this world, wee are truly miſerable, and that we are not in our owne Country, but in a very painefull ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and ſoe <hi>rayſing firſt our hartes to heauen, let our conuerſation be alſoe there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the end why our Lord hath puniſhed you, that you may make more, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, the more you ſee your ſelfe, in want, otherwiſe doe not conceiue that God takes pleaſure in your paine, but becauſe he is mercifull he hath a tender feeling of your tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

God hath taken one comfort from you, but it is to giue you another, for ſoe he is wont to doe. He hath made you a widow, but it is that he may make himſelfe your Father, ſince, <hi>Father of the forſaken,</hi>

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.</note> is his name. Many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions will not faile to offer themſelues to you, in this widowhood; and in many things you will finde the want of him, who was wont to remedy you in them. And in many of your freinds, you ſhall finde little helpe, and little fidelity and leſſe gratitude; but in all theſe things, God will haue you make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15877:97"/>to him, and conferre with him, about the troubles you ſhall be in, and that, as with a true Father, you eaſe your hart, with him. And if with that hart you call vpon him, and truſt your ſelfe in his hands infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly you ſhall meete with a ſure refuge, in all your difficulties, and a perfect guide in all your wayes. And in any tymes without your knowing by whoſe meanes, or how it comes to paſſe, you ſhall finde your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes done, to your hand, much better then you could haue imagined; and you ſhall then vnderſtand by experience, how great a freind God is, to the afflicted; and how truely he dwells with them, and makes himſelfe a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citour of their cauſes.</p>
               <p>And if at any tyme, he doe not giue you that, which you deſire; it will be to giue you that which ſhall be fitt. For ſo doth this celeſtiall phiſitian proceede, with them, who goe to him for their recovery; and whoe haue a greater deſire, to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then that their taſte be pleaſed. Depart not you, from his hands, and cure, though it ſhould put you to much paine. Deſire him not to doe what you will, but what he will. Let your weapons, be your prayers, and your teares, and they, not loſt teares, for that which our Lord hath taken from you, but liuing teares, for that our Lord may be pleaſed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him and to ſaue you.</p>
               <p>For what doth that ſuperfluous paine
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15877:98"/>ſerue which they tell mee you giue your ſelfe, but onely, for the adding of ſinne, to paine. But now you know, that as wee haue no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to laugh, idely or vainely, ſoe neither haue we any to weepe ſuperfluouſly. But both in the one, and in the other, we muſt be obedient to the holy will of our Lord. Why doe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine? why, I ſay, doe you complaine? Either you are a ſinner, and then you are to be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this affliction; or els you are a iuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then you muſt bee tryed, that you may be crowned. whether it be the one or the other, you muſt giue thanks to our lord, with your whole hart, and reſolue to loue the end and reaſon of this correction, though the thing it ſelfe be vnpleaſing. This we are taught by <hi>holy Scripture,</hi>

               <p>Let not your tyme paſſe away, in glutting your eyes with teares; but for the loue of our Lord, apply your ſelfe to ſend your hart vp to him, and to prepare your ſelfe for that paſſage, whereby you ſee others march before. It is enough, Lady, it is enough, that you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made ſoe large a feaſt to fleſh and blood. Dry your eyes at laſt, and let not that tyme paſſe in bewayling death, which was graunted you for the gayning of life.</p>
               <p>Call to minde, that our Lord droue them out of the howſe, who lamented the death of a yong maide; and he ſaid <hi>that she was not dead, but that she ſlept.</hi> For indeede amongſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15877:98"/>to dye is but to fall a ſleepe, till that day come, when we ſhall awake againe, to take our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and ſo to raigne with Chriſt our Lord, both in body, and ſoule. And confider, that hee for whome you weepe, <hi>is not dead but ſleepes;</hi> and that, in a ſleepe of peace, ſince he both liued end dyed a good Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould it trouble you ſoe much, that our lord would draw the man whome you loued, out of this place, which is ſoe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and would carry him into the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? And if he haue left ſome troubles to you, take them vp with a good will, ſoe that he may goe on to his repoſe. And if his abſence afflict you much, yet be comforted with this, that ſhortly you ſhall ſee him againe; ſince our dayes in this life are ſoe very fewe, and one of vs hath ſoe little aduantage ouer the other, in dying a little ſooner, or later. You ſhall doe alſoe well to conceiue, that our Lord tooke him away, becauſe hee was well prepared, and that he hath leſt you heere, to the end that you may well prepare your ſelfe. And ſince you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued our Lord with alacrity, in the ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſerue him now in the ſtate of widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and in the trouble of that ſtate, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. That ſoe, if then you gayned <hi>thirty fold,</hi> you may now gaine <hi>ſixty.</hi> And ſoe you ſhall leade a life, if not of guſt, yet, at the leaſt of great profitt, towards the purging of your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; towards the imitation of the Crucifixe; and towards a moſt certaine purchaſe of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15877:99"/>eternall kingdome.</p>
               <p>But for the obteyning of all this, you muſt demaund grace of our Lord, with prayers, with teares, with vſing to read deuout bookes, and with receiuing the celeſtiall bread of the moſt <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament.</hi> And ſoe lift vpp your deiected hart, and walke roundly on. For before you can gett to heauen, you will haue a longe way to make. And if you be to enter there, this will not be the laſt affliction, which you ſhall haue. For the Iewell which you expect, is of ſoe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a valew (it being God himſelfe) that how much ſoeuer it coſt, it can neuer be deere. And ſince you are one day to poſſeſſe it, you are now to reioyce in the hope thereof. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not of your afflictions, but ſay, <hi>ſoe great is the good for which I hope, that I feele not the miſery which I haue.</hi> Let <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt our Lord, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all this in you, as I deſire, and begg of him.

For it is a ſigne of greater loue, when for his ſake, we forbeare that which we might lawfully vſe.

The holy Ghoſt is moſt pure, and farre eſtraunged from fleſh, and when he findes a ſoule which reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſpiſes carnall delights, there doth he lodge his eyes; and fills them with ſpirituall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15877:101"/>comforts, and will neuer permitt that the ſoule be empty, which ſhall refuſe to feede vpon carnall foode. Our Bleſſed Lady is the mother of the ſpouſe, and they are very like one another, for ſhee alſoe is all amiable, benigne, a beginner, a protectour, and an aduocate of virgins, and ſhee highly reioyces that there is virginity vpon earth, for that is the flower which ſhe planted. There want not pages to giue attendance at this marriage, for the Angells are ſeruants to the king of heauen, and ready for all that, which the ſpouſe ſhall neede. Neither yet is there want of children which the world is wont to deſire ſoe much; and they come without throwes of trauaile, and without paine in bringing vp, and without that greife which growes, when either they liue not well, or dye too ſoone.</p>
               <p>The children of this marriage are good workes, which be rightly called a man's or woman's fruite. What comfort will he feele, when for the loue of Chriſt our Lord, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues a good purpoſe, to giue an almes, or ſome ſuch other thing; and when afterward he ſhall put it in execution, what pleaſure will he take by the birth thereof? Theſe children giue both eaſe, and honour to their mother. This Spouſe hath noe neede of a dowry, for the children which ſhee brings, will bring it; and that ſoe richly, as wherewith ſhe may gaine, and purchaſe heauen it ſelfe. And they make their mother liue in ſoe perfect eaſe, that I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:15877:102"/>giue you my word, that when you compoſe your ſelfe to ſleepe at night, you ſhall finde your ſelfe in greater peace, and reſt, then if you were Myſtres of the whole earth, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer can be deſired therein.</p>
               <p>And tell me now what can be thought of in this world, which may arriue or euen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the leaſt of theſe aduantages? For if there be any little paltry pleaſure heere, euery hower of ſuch pleaſure carryes with it the counterpoyſe of more then a hundred howers of greife and paine. And if heere there be any pleaſure without paine, it will at laſt haue an end, and either the ſpouſe will dye before her fellow ſpouſe, or els he before her, and ſoe all proues paine. And beſides the death of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is a greife to a mother to part from them, euen vpon other occaſions, in ſuch ſort, as that they enioy not one another.</p>
               <p>But reioyce you O virgin in Chriſt our Lord. For your ſpouſe ſhall neuer dye. And when you dye you will be hemmed in by your children, which are thoſe good workes that you haue wrought; and they will not put you to paine by your leauing them, for they goe with you, into the other world; and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you euen to the very throne of God, and they will plentifully repay all the labour and charge, which you haue beene at with them, and the mother ſhall be made happy for the loue of the children. More ouer death makes noe diuorce in this caſe, but rather puts
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15877:102"/>the ſpouſe, and her fellow ſpouſe together. And he ſhall deliuer vs, for he is the Lord of life and death. And noe deuill ſhall preſume to ſteale her away, whome God hath taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of his fauour; and hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the name of his ſpouſe. Then will the Angells come and ſerue, and preſent her before Almighty God, ſinging prayſes to him, and powring forth benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon her, and ſaying to her after this manner. <hi>Come O ſpouſe of Chriſt, receiue that crowne which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee by our Lord.</hi> The virgin mother will not then abſent herſelfe, being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with a world of other virgins, who haue done in this world that which you are doeing now, and are farre from repenting themſelues thereof. In fine you ſhall goe out of this world, in company of your Peeres, where our Lord hath already prepared that celeſtiall bedd of ſtate for yow, that you may eternally be full, and rich, and royally prouided for, in the houſe and preſence of our Lord God, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that infinite beauty of his, from one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another, one hower whereof is ſo high a reward, that by way of recompence it farre exceedes the proportion of what you ſuffer, yea and all thoſe afflictions which all the men of the whole world did euer ſuffer, in tyme paſt, or can euer ſuffer, in tyme to come.</p>
               <p>There ſhall you poſſeſſe all good, and there ſhall you haue obtayned all that, for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15877:103"/>which you were created, and you ſhall bee ſoe very full of God, as that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nor ſoe much as thought. For there ſhall you finde the whole boſome of your ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, euen to regorge with ioy, like one whoe were ingulfed into a whole ſea of vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweetenes, whereby he were enuironed on all ſides. Then ſhall you ſee, and exclayme, and enioy, and poſſeſſe the Lord of all things, and ſay, <hi>whome I haue loued I haue obteyned; and whome I haue ſought I haue found; and hee for whome I left the world is growen my pay, and my reward, and him will I praiſe, and loue, through the eternitie of all eternityes.

               <p>GOD giue you Sir a good Lent, and that ſoe you may exteriourly take aſhes, in the begining of this holy tyme, that the vertue of holy <hi>humility,</hi> which is ſignifyed thereby, may euer haue a reſting place in your ſoule. For to whome our Lord giues true knowledge, and greife for what he was, at that tyme when he went eſtraunged from God, him hath he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the daungerous blindenes of pride, and him doth he make capable of all thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings which it may concerne him to haue. The holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>The begining of all miſcheife is pride, and he whoe is poſſeſſed by it, shall be poſſeſſed by all manner of maledictions,</hi> that is, of vices. For as kings are not wont to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſoe is <hi>Pride</hi> accompanyed with many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And ſoe alſoe on the other ſide, <hi>humility</hi> is neuer alone, ſince according to Saint <hi>Iames. God giues his grace to ſuch as are humble,</hi> which <hi>Grace</hi> is the Mother of all vertue.</p>

The proud man cannot endure nor liue with any body, noe nor euen with himſelfe, in peace. But the humble man can liue with all the world, for he abaſes himſelfe to all, he endures all, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them for his betters, in his very hart; To the proud man it ſeemes an vnſupportable thing to obey the will of others, whether it be of God or man; but the man whoe is humble ſubmitts and diminiſhes himſelfe, and ſoe is enabled to goe in, by the ſtraite gate of doeing the will of others, whether it be of the Creatour or of the creatures.</p>

And through our ſinnes, we haue ſoe much matter to worke vpon, by way of examining, and bewayling the ſame, that, vnleſſe it be ſome man who will abſent his eyes from looking vpon himſelfe, there is none, who may not be ſure to finde cauſe, and cauſe enough, not onely to be humbled, but euen confounded.</p>
               <p>Woe be to vs! if we be found to be of them, of whome God ſaith, <hi>Thou art become as the face of a ſtrumpet, nor wouldſt thou blush.</hi> For what thing is there more deformed then the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent boldnes of ſuch a perſon, as hath ſo much reaſon to be full of ſhame? And who is he that dares once caſt vp his eyes to God or his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if he conſider well, how he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, &amp; made himſelfe vnworthy of them? who is there amongſt vs, who failes not in the perfect loue which he owes to God? ſince wee loue him not with our whole vnderſtanding, beleiuing his truth with that firme conſtancy
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15877:106"/>which is fitt; and enterteyning thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe thoughts, and purpoſes, by meanes whereof, we might doe him more faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? who is he who loues him with his whole hart, not giuing any parte thereof to others, yea or to himſelfe, but onely in God and for God? and who renouncing all proper intereſt, hath proceeded to loue God, for God himſelfe? And he who shall conſider, how little he hath mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his paſſions, and what a ſtiffe warre he makes againſt the kingdome of the loue of God, will eaſily diſcerne that he loues not God with all his ſoule? And our Lord commaunding vs alſoe to loue him with all our ſtrength, we are yet content to doe it, with ſuch a deale of tepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as wee may well deſire him to pardon. For, the ſtrength which wee employ vpon complying with the loue of our ſelues, and appetites being ſoe aliue in vs, makes vs mightily faile in the diligence which we owe to the ſeruice of God, and to the feruour of our loue of him. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſaith, that the encreaſe of Charitie in vs, is the decreaſe of our owne appetites and deſires; and then will our charity be perfect, when there shall be noe ſuch deſires in vs at all. Now by the name of ſuch deſires, he vnderſtands that inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ſelfe loue which euery one beares to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And becauſe amongſt all them who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Adam, there is noe one, (excepting onely <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt our Lord, and his moſt ſacred <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) who hath not found in himſelfe, ſome exceſſe of this ſelfe loue; therefore is there none
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15877:106"/>of them, who hath not fay led ſomewhat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the loue of God. For when the loue of my ſelfe is wholly aliue in mee, the loue of God is dead; and then is a man in ſtate of Mortall ſinne. And when the loue of God liue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes in mee (in vertue of which loue I fully purpoſe not to offend God mortally) then am I in ſtate of grace, though I may faile ſomewhat, of that perfect loue of God, becauſe ſtill I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in ſomewhat with the loue either of my ſelfe or of creatures. And from this want of diuine loue, doth grow our faultines in our other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, becauſe that is the life of them. From hence alſoe proceede the faultes we make in the loue of our neighbours, by our not hauing compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their miſeryes; nor taking ioy in their bleſſings, as concerning perſons who are very ſtraightly ioyned to God, and adopted in the Sacrament of Baptiſme for his children. And we alſoe faile in our workes towards them, becauſe we faile in our loue to him who ſaid. <hi>That which you haue done to any of my little ones, you haue done to mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from the defect of theſe two Loues, of God, and of our neighbour (which are the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of our good workes) many other imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grow into thoſe very workes which we doe, though ſometymes ſuch workes themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, are not ſinnes, nay being performed in the ſtate of grace, they are meritorious of eternall life; But of ſuch as theſe (if we meane to liue in the way of humility and truth) wee are to giue
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15877:107"/>the glory to God, and to yeild him humble thankes, who holpe vs to embrace that which was good with our free will, and ordeyned, that it ſhould be meritorious, by that <hi>Grace</hi> which through his mercy, he beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs.</p>
               <p>Now wee muſt not, vpon this reaſon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſifte out thoſe faultes with care, which we comitt to theſe actions of ours; but it is a much more ſecure practiſe, to conſider very particularly, that which is faulty in vs, then that which may goe for a point of vertue. And be well aſſured, that how much ſoeuer you ſhall conſider, and ſifte, yet ſtill there will much lye hidden from you, in regard whereof you ſhall haue reaſon enough to ſay, with deepe ſighing to our Lord, <hi>O clenſe me from my hidden ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence comes it, that wee loue not our neighbours, in ſuch ſorte, as God would haue vs, or at leaſt, not ſo much as hee would haue vs. Hence comes it, that wee tollerate not their imperfections, nor fly from giuing them diſguſts. And in fine from hence grow all thoſe other faultes, which defile our ſoules like filth, which is euer dropping as from a ſore. Our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are greater then any thought of man is able to vnderſtand, and onely he who created our hart and cleerely penetrates to the bottome of it, is able to comprehend what our frailty is. And many tymes doth that diſcouer it ſelfe to be filthy before his iudgment, which ſeemes, in the ſight of ours, to be very perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15877:107"/>as <hi>Iob</hi> hath ſhowed vs the way we muſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all our workes, how good ſoeuer they may ſeeme to vs, and we muſt not take pleaſure in our ſelues by reaſon of them, nor delight our ſelues therein, euen in the moſt ſecret part of our hartes. For he onely is pleaſing to God, who is diſpleaſing to himſelfe; he onely is Iuſt in the ſight of God whoe knowes that grace and Iuſtice proceedes from the mercy of God. There is not a thing, from which God is more auerted, then a hart which carryes liking to it ſelfe. For God in ſuch a one findes noe veſſell empty, into which he may powre the riches of his mercy, and ſoe ſuch a hart remaines with the naturall pouerty, wherewith, and wherein it ſhall ſtill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, becauſe it would not abaſe and empty it ſelfe, that ſoe the waters of Grace might runne into it, and ſoe it might liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in God, and might bring forth fruite, as a garden would doe, wherein there were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water.</p>
               <p>All our good comes from God; &amp; he whoe beleiues that of himſelf he is able euen to moue his tongue towards the ſaying ſoe much as <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> that perſon makes himſelfe God ſince he attributes that to himſelfe which onely belongs to God. And God giues himſelfe to vs vpon condition that we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this truth: That in him, &amp; of him, comes all our good, and not from our ſelues. And the more good we haue, the greater debters of his wee are, and ſoe much more we haue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15877:108"/>to accuſe our ſelues, as not correſponding to greater fauours by greater ſeruices, and to greater benefits by greater acknowledgments. He who is taught by the diuine truth, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes nothing to himſelfe, but <hi>Not being and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> For if wee remoue all that which God gaue vs when he created vs, and which euery day he conſerues in vs; wee ſhall not finde any <hi>being</hi> in vs, but onely a <hi>nothing,</hi> and that to nothing we ſhould returne, as of nothing we are made. And taking alſoe away the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God which through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is communicated vs, what ſhould become of the greateſt Saint on earth, but that which became of <hi>Peeter,</hi> when he denyed his Lord, and of <hi>Paule</hi> who perſecuted him, that had redeemed him; and that which euery one findes by experience, that himſelfe was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord carryed his hand ouer him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from him his old hart, and giuing him a new one in place thereof.</p>
               <p>Iuſtification is nothing elſe, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the ſoule which was dead in ſinne, and now liues by the ſpiritt of that life, which God infuſed into it, by the death of his bleſſed ſonne. And as that body ſhould bee both madd and fooliſh, which would attribute life and motion to it ſelfe, and not to the ſoule which dwells in it, and giues it life; ſoe is that ſoule deadly blinde, which eſteemes that the life of good workes, which ſhe findes her ſelfe to haue,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15877:108"/>doth proceede from her ſelfe, and not from the ſpirit of that life, which was infuſed into her by Almighty God. And ſometymes God puniſhes ſuch ſoules as theſe, by taking away that which formerly hee had giuen them, to the end, that obſeruing that they can neither ſee, nor heare, nor taſte, nor in fine, doe that which formerly they did, it may be plaine to them that it was ſome other, who impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that life which was in them; and that they did but receiue it; &amp; that the ſoule is noe other thing without the grace of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> then the body is when the ſoule departs from the ſame.</p>
               <p>And therefore my freind, be ſure that thou ſee noe other thing in thy ſelfe, but faultes, and know that thou haſt nothing elſe of thine owne. If our Lord diſcomfors thee, conſider how weake and poore thou groweſt, and with how little conformity thou receiueſt that, which thou doeſt ſoe well deſerue. If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, conſider with how little humility thou receiueſt it, it being reaſon that thou ſhouldſt ſoe much the more abaſe thy ſelfe, as God honours thee; and that by ſoe much more thou ſhouldſt be confounded with ſhame, as thou ſeeſt, that God treates thee, as though thou wert good, when indeede thou art not ſoe. Conſider how little profitt thou makeſt of the inſpirations, and inward ſpeeches of our Lord; and how often our Lord ſaith ſomewhat to thee, and how ſoone thou forgetteſt to put it in execution; it being reaſon, that euery
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15877:109"/>word of his, ſhould laſt with thee all the dayes of thy life; without any neede of repeating it. How often doeth our Lord infuſe pretious liquor into thee, and thou, hauing a hart all full of holes, doeſt ſuffer that to bee ſpilt; which in reaſon, thou ſhouldeſt keepe a long tyme? And though it would be ſitt, that how much more God comforts thee, ſoe much more thou ſhouldſt forgett and neglect the comforts of this world, and ſoe much more vnite and ſhutt vp thy ſoule, to the end that thou mighteſt againe and againe receiue God into it, it happens ſometymes, that by the comfort, which he giues vs, wee are made more giddy, through our owne lightnes, and wee ſcatter and powre out our harts more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. What ſhall wee ſay of our frailties, but that euery thing being well examined, we finde, that wee doe nothing right, and that it were much reaſon, that we ſhould rather be confounded, by conſidering how faultily it is performed, then that once it ſhould paſſe by the leaſt parte of our thoughts, that we had done any thing which were worth the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on.</p>
               <p>It is certaine, that if a Page ſerue a king, and that he make him not due reuerence, they will puniſh him. If he anſweare not, or doe it not ſoone enough, or giue not a quicke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any meſſage, they will alſoe puniſh him. And in fine they whome we ſerue are not contented, though we doe what they bidd vs,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15877:109"/>but withall we muſt doe it well, if we meane not to be reprehended and reproached.</p>
               <p>And tell mee now my freind, which of vs is he, who carryes ſuch a profound reuerence to our Lord as is fitt? where is that adoration of ſuch an incomprehenſible Maieſty, and ſuch a profound internall kind of trembling, as they haue in heauen, of whome it is ſaid in the holy <hi>Maſſe, That the Powers tremble?</hi> Where is that confuſion and ſhame; which we ſhould haue, to appeare before that infinite wiſedome, which well doth ſee what kind of things we are, &amp; which diſcouers vs to the very bottome? where is that ſoe exact obedience, as that we ſhould not neede to haue the ſame thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded twice? where is that diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ought to ſerue ſuch a thing as God? where is the gratitude which is due for ſoe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable and ſoe vnſpeakeable benefitts? And laſtly where is that ſeruice both of body and ſoule, which is deſerued by ſoe high a lord, and ſoe great a God?</p>
               <p>Certainely hee who hath eyes to ſee, will neuer diſcouer in himſelfe any thing els, but a profoundity of miſeries and faultes. And when in the euening hee takes account of himſelfe, what kind of man he hath beene all that day, he findes nothing, but errours which he hath committed, in thinking, ſpeaking, and doeing, and he findes diuers good workes which hee hath failed to doe, by not hauing loued and being thankfull to God, and by not

And if with the fauour of our Lord, he haue done any thing which was good, he ſindes that hee ſpotted it with pride, or vaine glory, or tepidity, or with not anſwering God as he was bound to doe, or with two thouſand other faultes which God makes him know, and with two thouſand others which yet he is not able to diſcerne, but yet he beleiues that there they are; and for ſoe wicked doth hee eſteeme himſelfe, as that the leaſt parte of his ſinnes he holds to be that, which he diſcouers. For as he knowes that God is more good, then he is able to conceiue, ſoe alſoe doth he belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that himſelfe is more wicked then he can arriue to vnderſtand. And though God doe him fauours, yet doth he not attribute to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe any parte thereof, but onely the faultes which he committed, in not anſwearing, and profiting thereby, as he ſhould haue done.</p>
               <p>And this is to walke according to truth, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that to God which is his; That is to ſay, all manner of good, without the leaſt mixture of any ill. And by this conſideration being rooted well in the bowels of a man's hart (as a truth which were deliuered by the very mouth of God) a man riſes, from leaning vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; as from ſome broken reede, and he euer goes leaning vpon him, who vphoulds all
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:15877:110"/>things. He behoulds himſelfe, and hee ſees nothing, but that which is to be lamented; and he behoulds God; in whoſe goodnes he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; without any feare to be forſaken. And for aſmuch as God is ſoe faithfull, as that he neuer leaues them whoe goe to him, and for that he hath ſoe great care of them; as that infinitely ſooner, there will be want of water in the Sea, and of light in the ſunne, then of mercy in him; therefore doe they runne, and fly, becauſe God carryes them, and they falle not, becauſe be ſuſtaines them, and they wander not, becauſe he directs them, and they ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe our Lord giues his kingdome to ſuch as <hi>become like little children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bee therefore ſure, my freind, that thou vnderſtand thy ſelfe right, ſince our Lord doth ſoe much expect it of thee. And of all that which paſſes in thee, lay the glory aſide for God, and take the ſhame and diſhonour to thy ſelfe. And place thy hope, of being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, as thou haſt begun, in that Lord who put thee in the way; with noe meaning, I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thee, to leaue thee in the middeſt thereof, but to carry thee on, to enioy the ſociety of his ſpouſes in heauen. There doeth he intend to doe thee extraordinary honour, and therefore procure not thou to be honoured heere. For being taken by the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſuch an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feaſt as that, it is vtterly againſt all reaſon, that thou ſhouldſt glutt thy ſelfe, with the baſenes of any thing, which this world affoardes. For there is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:15877:111"/>nothing vpon earth, which can ſauour well in his mouth, who hath taſted, though but a litle, of that celeſtiall foode. Turne thy backe to all things, which thou art ſoone to leaue, &amp; place not thy hart on that, which is ſoe inſtantly to paſſe away. It is very litle, which heere thou art able to endure for God, yea though thou alone ſhouldeſt endure all that, which can be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heere. For conſidering hell, which thou haſt deſerued, and heauen with which he meanes thou ſhalt be rewarded (ſince he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee in the way thither) and againe, waighing that which heere he hath endured for thee; it is not to be accounted of, noe nor ſo much as to be greately conſidered, which thou either doeſt, or mayeſt endure for him.</p>
               <p>Eſteeme thou God for ſoe pretious a thing, that whatſoeuer he growes to coſt thee, thou maieſt ſtill beleeue it to bee very little; yea though he coſt thee thy life, yet doeſt thou buy him very cheape. In the next world, thou ſhalt ſee, that thou wert not deceiued, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge which thou haſt made, but finding them to be treated like madd fooles, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons, who lodged their harts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted themſelues, vpon this preſent world, and forgot the promiſes which God made concerning the future, thou wilt giue praiſes to our Lord, in that thou being once decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he vouchſafed to vndeceiue thee, and whileſt thou wert caſting thine eyes downe to earth, he was pleaſed to raiſe them vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:15877:111"/>and thou being a ſlaue to vanity, hee made thee a ſonne of his owne; and when thou wert liuing without any hope of diuine promiſes, he grew to place thee in that way, wherein thou maieſt hope, that he will helpe thee now to liue well, and afterwards to dye well. And that when this exile is ended; he will conduct thee <hi>to the land of the liuing;</hi> which is the cleere fruition of the face of God. Where thou ſhall enioy ſoe great happines, that it belongs to God alone to know it perfectly, as to him alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne it belongs, both to be able, and to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue it. And this will our Lord doe, not for thy ſake, but for his owne, becauſe hee is good, and his mercy endures for euer. To whome, for all, and of all, and in all, be glory and praiſe, for all eternities of eternities. Amen.</p>

               <p>O Sir, how much reaſon haue you, to be gratefull for the good which you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and carefull, at the leaſt, to keepe it; and fearefull, leaſt it ſhould ſlippe out of your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15877:112"/>ſince the gate is open, for our getting more, and more in euery minute of our life.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certaine, that if we ſhould tell a man, that there were a very long way, in the ſteppes whereof there were great felicity to be obtayned, yea and that, for the making of one ſingle pace, they would giue him the worth of a whole kingdome; and that though a man ſhould goe all his life time, in that way, they would neuer depriue him, of his rewarde, but that ſtill it ſhould holde on, after the rate, of the firſt pace, which he had made; I doe not thinke, that in the whole world there is any one worldly man, who in this caſe, would not be ſo great a walker, as that he would hardly be euer perſwaded to ſitt ſtill. Now, if coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of viſible things be able to worke ſo great effects; what will it be fitt, that the loue of that, which is inuiſible and eternall, ſhould worke in our ſoules, but a vigilant care, to be ſtill walking on, in the way of God, with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions as liuely, and more, then they were, which we entertayned the firſt day, when we entred into his ſeruice.</p>

He ſeemes not to haue bene ſorrie for his offence, who procures not with diligence to be farre from the like. He doth not ſufficiently thanke our Lord for this guift, who hath layde aſide the memory thereof, &amp; with whome it decayes with time; not ſtirring himſelf vp, to giue new thankes, and to preſente new ſeruices, knowing more and more thereof, euery day, as a perſon, who hath receiued encreaſe of light: This is ſo great a fauour, that Dauid calles it the <hi>Benedictions of ſweeteneſſe.</hi> And it is great reaſon, that we ſhould grow ſtrong with that new grace,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>20.</hi>

               <p>Tell me, good Sir, how is it with you? are you ſtill on foote in the preſence of your God? doe you liue, in the preſence of <hi>true life?</hi> is God

Or is there not perhaps, ſome litle dryneſſe or diſagreement growen betweene you, which your much care of this world, and your little care to pleaſe your Lord, may haue cauſed? I feare to heare the anſweare, which you may chance to giue; and yet I cannot content my ſelfe to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing it. If you giue me good newes, my ſoule will reioyce in our Lord, and I will giue him thankes for hauing conſerued, what he hath gayned.

               <p>If there be any thing of this kinde, take heede you ſuffer not the wound to feſter; and make no intricate knotts vpon the ſwathing-bands of your ſinnes.

And you in particular may doe well, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this point; ſince, beſides the feare, which we all ought to haue of that paſſage, your ſelf haue another particular reaſon for it; becauſe you haue a more particular knowledge of death; for lately you wanted not, as a man may ſay, a fingar's breadth of paſſing through it, to eternity.</p>
               <p>Take heede, take heede, that you be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by thoſe falſe apparances, and by thoſe painted maskes; for they are no better then maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which enueagle &amp; deceaue our ſoules.

Do not entangle your ſelfe with this earth, ſince God, hath giuen you ſome good hopes, and pledges, that he meanes to carry you to heauen. And thoſe are, his moſt ſacred death, the knowledge, and loue of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> the receauing of the holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> whereby in the holy Church there is giuen a pardon of our ſinnes; and <hi>the adoption of the Sonnes of God,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>heyres.</hi> Let him ſeeke for ſhadowes, who hath no hope to lay holde, on things of ſubſtance.

And if notwithſtanding, it ſeeme to you, that ſtill he muſt be a liue; knowe yet, that he remaynes in extreme trouble, and euen as dead, to ſee himſelf ouercome, and to be the occaſion that you shall gayne crownes, whereas he thought that they would haue proued fetters.</p>
               <p>To what greater miſery can an enemy be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, then to ſee, that he helpes him, to be great, in the eyes of God. For if you ſawe the treaſure, which you haue gayned, by reſiſting the Deuill, ſoe very often; there is noe doubte, but that it would ſufficiently temper the bitternes of your troubles to conſider the beawty and riches of thoſe crownes. Now ſo many pretious ſtones haue you gotten, wherewith to enrich your crowne, as you haue reſiſted, times, thoſe counſailes of the Deuill; and ſo much haue you gained of eternall reſt, as you haue with patience, endured ſeuerall times, the ſadd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which he hath brought vpon you. Be

Our Lord takes care of mee, what then can arriue, which may afflict mee? Our lord gouernes mee, and I am ſafe Our lord ſerues himſelf of mee, and I aspire to no other happines, how much ſoeuer it may coſt mee.</hi> And thus, the Deuill finding you full of courage, and well armed, shall not bee able to pull you downe, but rather feare, ſoe much as to aſſault you.

               <p>THE newes of this meſſenger, who is parting, takes me by night, and without paper, and full of my ordinary indiſpoſitions. I beſeech our lord, who is omnipotent, to tell you that by himſelfe, which he was to haue tould you by my penne; ſince in me there is noe ability to doe it, nor haue I indeede any opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaintes you make againſt your ſelfe, vpon the opinion which you had of your owne prudence, are iuſt. You muſt admitt them, &amp; doe them iuſtice; euer eſteeming that opinion for a crafty enemye, and counting vp euery pace it makes, that ſoe you may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the deceites thereof. For in theſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to know them, is to ouercome them. Make that very account with your ſelfe, which was made by that Monke, in this namer; <hi>I came not to iudge any, but to be iudged by all.</hi> Say thus to your ſelfe; <hi>I came not to haue zeale of others but of my ſelfe. God places not me in the office of a guide, but in the duty of being guided.</hi> And who is ſoe maddly impertinent, as that hee will thinke to hitt right, in that, where God puttes him not; ſince euery <hi>plantation which is not made by the heauenly father, shall be rooted vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:15877:119"/>
               <p>But now, if by <hi>Obedience</hi> you be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deliuer your minde, firſt begg you light of our lord, and then declare it, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and as a thing which you doe but offer, to the end that it may be examined by others. And you are not to shoot it out, with ſuch a kind of reſolution, and auctority, as if it muſt needes be approued, and executed, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe forſooth you thought it fitt. Noe nor that it ought to haue any force att all, vpon that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but onely, that things may ſoe be done, as others may take to be moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they approue or diſallow your opinion. And you muſt conceiue, that by doeing thus, you comply with the duty of your <hi>Obedience,</hi> and that you haue nothing more to doe in that buſines.</p>
               <p>They, who either be endwed with light from heauen, or haue elſe beene taught to ſee, by the many falles, which they haue taken; doe noe leſſe feare, euen ſome good deſires of particular thinges, then the executing of ſome deſires, which are not good. Yea, and in ſome ſorte, they apprehend them more becauſe of the two, it is harder to vnderſtand and maiſter the deceipt, which lurkes in them. Now this <hi>feare,</hi> takes order that they runne not inſtantly to entertaine them, but to keepe their ſtand; recommending that deſire of theirs to our lord, and asking councell of him. This <hi>feare</hi> is the beginning of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and it is alſoe the end thereof. It is hard to declare this pointe by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15877:120"/>but for him who hath a ſuperiour, whome he obeyes, it is eaſily declared, by putting the caſe, and following his counſell.</p>
               <p>When you shall be come to know, that ſuch a buſines concernes the ſeruice of God, and that it is fitt to be diſpatched, yet ſtill euen that muſt be done in ſuch ſorte, as that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty be not offended, for whoſe ſeruice the buſines it to be vndertaken. For if the heart be thereby filled, with cares and diſtractions, and eſpecially if they come at wrong tymes, the thing it ſelfe may well be iuſt, but the manner of doeing it, wil not be ſoe. It is a good thing, for a man to cary himſelfe like a perſone who is at the comaund of another; and not as a guide of the buſines. Not as if you were ſome great maiſter, but rather like ſome young fellow, who were bidden, eyther to come, or goe when the care of any particular shall put it ſelfe vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably vpon you; ſay to it, to this effect, <hi>Our lord commaundes me nothing, about that matter at this time; For my part, I haue nothing to thinke; all will goe into errour, if it be done after my fancye when our lord shall commaund me to doe it, I will doe it, and I will both heare, and ſpeake.</hi> For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is good to ſett out ſome determinate ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to thinke of theſe thinges, which require care; that ſoe they may not come vpon a man, in troupes, when he were to be in ſilence with God. If they bring any affliction with them, which much diſquiet; we may well conceiue that that is not the way, wherein God walkes:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15877:120"/>nor doe we comply with his word, which ſaith, <hi>Nolite ſolicit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He who hath this confidence, perceiues well, that the buſines dependes vpon God; and that his diuine wiſedome, knowes how to addreſſe him, and therefore a Chriſtian man, is to be perſwaded, that it giues noe aduantage, euen to the very buſines it ſelfe, if we fall into any vnquiet kinde of anguish; or euen to ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thinking of it, which is thus forbidden, by holy ſcripture. <hi>Ne affligas temetipſum in conſilio tuo: Doe not afflict thy ſelfe in thine owne counſell:</hi> but ſay thus to your ſelfe, <hi>It is God who muſt doe it, and not I. Perhaps our lord will not haue it remedied by this meanes. And if he will, yet his will alſoe is that it be done with peace, and with my ſpirituall gaine, and without my loſſe.</hi> And ſoe procure, that your heart may euer goe, in celebration of that. <hi>Chriſtian Sabaoth,</hi> whereof S.

               <p>
                  <hi>My</hi> good ſiſter, (for I will preſume to ſay, that you are <hi>mine,</hi> becauſe you are the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of my Lord) O how happy were he, who might know how it is with you; that ſoe he might either be delighted in your good, or receiue the torment of ſorrow, for your <hi>ill?</hi> how happy were he, who might know, if thoſe feruent teares of yours ſtill continue, which waſhed your ſoule in the high preſence of your <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and which watered it with deuotion, that ſoe it might giue fruit to the Lord thereof.

S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaid, that euen his very life, conſiſted in the good of his children; and euen I, though not with that great fire, but with the little, which God giues mee, doe yet adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to ſay, that my life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtes, in that you be well, in the ſight of God.

And vpon this motiue, you muſt forget that I haue beene an ill Father to you; ſince vpon the ſame, God forgets that we haue been ill ſonnes &amp; ill ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to him.

For in this our Lord, hath not permitted that I should be forgetfull. For ſoe great was the loue, which I carryed towards you, vpon ſeeing that you were growne to be the true ſeruant of God; and you entred ſoe deepely into my hart, when I conſidered thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, which our Lord had vouchſafed to you; that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer parted more from thence, though it haue failed, to ſtrengthen and comfort you in this way as it should haue done.</p>
               <p>Pardon me my good Siſter for the loue of <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt; and bee not cruel againſt yourfelfe, but be as cruell againſt me, as you shall thinke fit. Be ſure to loue our Lord, for he deſerues not to be ill vſed, for the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15877:123"/>negligence of his ſeruant. And if you ſhould haue forgotten your duety to him you know his condition already well enough, and, that he hath promiſed to receiue the ſoule which will retourne and that if you will forgiue me he wil pardon you. And he will ſhew you ſuch mercyes, as he ſhewed before, and wil enable you to ſing thoſe Canticles to him, which you ſung in your firſt beginning, and birth, to Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Doe not now giue cauſe of ioy, to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal ſpirits, ſince there was a time, wherein you wounded them with ſorrow. Doe not greiue your good Angel, ſince he hath giuen God much praiſe for you; and hath reioyced at your <hi>vocation.</hi> Doe not reuerſe that ſolemne Feſtiuity, which was celebrated in the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of heauen, vpon the day of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion. And if through my ſinnes any of theſe things ſhould haue happened, yet ſtill you muſt not be diſmayed. For our Lord will ſtretch forth his armes, and will receiue you; ſince he ſtretched them out for you vpon the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> And it is vſual with him, to loue that perſon more, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing runn away out of the warr doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to fight with greater courage, then that other, who though he neuer forſook the feild, yet was neuer but ſlack in doeing him ſeruice.</p>
               <p>This is a kind of warr, wherein the loſſe of the victory conſiſts not in the not receiuing any woundes, but in flying out of the battaille, &amp; rendring himſelfe to the enemye, in the quality
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15877:123"/>of a man who is ouercome. Take courage, and begin yet once againe, for you ſhall find Chriſt our Lord cloſe at hand to help you. And ſeing your humility, and how much you are aſhamed of yourſelfe, he will not put you to confuſion. Nor when he ſhall perceiue, that you are lying proſtrate at his feete, will he caſt you off, or kick you out of his ſight. And if you call vpon thoſe interceſſours, of yours, who are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they will not make themſelues deafe to the cryes which you ſend vp from hence, As for me becauſe I haue made the fault, whereby you haue incurred the inconuenience, if there be any, I wil alſoe performe the pennance as I ſaid before. And I wil beſeech our Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore and raiſe that vp, which my negligence made fit for ruine. Let all your thoughts beate vpon his hauing begunn the worke, and not vpon my hauing neglected it. And then he will put things in good order, becauſe he is the true louer of ſoules, and pretends not to ſee mens ſinnes, that ſoe they may retract them by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I beſeech him euen by what himſelf is, that he wil keep you in cloſe protection, vnder his wings; and make you gratious in his ſight, and that he wil puniſh me in whatſoeuer ſort he ſhal thinke fit. And I beg of you by him that you wil write to me, though I confeſſe myſelfe to be vnworthy of your anſweare.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15877:125"/>and will do ſo againe; and will deſpoyle them, to their great shame. And how ſoeuer it may ſeeme to you, that the encounter is fierce, and the enemie ſo ſtrong, as to fright you; be not yet diſmayde.<note place="margin">E ſaye <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> For it is our lord who ſayth: <hi>Shall perhaps the prize be taken out of the hand of the ſtrong man?

               <p>O that our eyes could once but ſee, that zeale of God, wherewith he keepes our ſoules, and how ſafely he claſpes them in his hand, euen when they thinke, that they are alreadie loſt. Some are wont to throw downe a glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, with ſpeede, to shew, how dexterouſly they can receaue a brickle thing in ſafetie, which is caſt, though neuer ſo ſpeedily, from on high. And if the glaſſe could feele and knowe, it would tremble to ſee it ſelf caſt downe ſo farre and ſo faſt, and to be falling towards hard ſtones, where it were likelie to be broken, into a hundred pieces. But then comes to ſuccour it, the other hand of him, who threw it downe; and ſo it is receaued without any hurt at all. And thus you who ſee your ſelf ſo drawen euen out of yourſelf,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:15877:125"/>aſſaulted with ſuch sharpe fyres, and afflicted by ſo fierce paynes, doe tremble and feare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that you shall be broken all to pieces, by falling into offences againſt our lord. But you muſt knowe and conſider, that our lord, who hath brought you into this trouble, he himſelf will bring you out: and he, who hides himſelf a while from you, that you may ſuffer, is yet very neare you for your defence. For otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, you had bene ſwallowed vp ten thouſand times ouer, by your enemies. He throwes you downe, and yet he receaues and ſaues you from falling. He moues the tempeſt, but yet he it is, who keepes you from drowning. For in that, which you feele, it is not you, who doe any thing, but you ſuffer it. He who doth it, is the deuill, and he shall pay for it.</p>
               <p>God ſees your hart perfectly well, and that you are a louer of his Commaundements, and one, who abhorres any thing, which is offenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue to him. I beſeech him to keepe you, as he hath done hitherto, for as for thoſe things, which the deuill repreſentes to your minde, be not troubled at all thereat. For though it be full of deformitie, and afflicte you much, yet you will not be the worſe for that. Theſe are things, which happen to manie, and not only theſe, to which you are ſubiect, but others alſo which are incomparably greater, and which ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to be a verie copie of the true hell, and of that language, which there they holde.</p>
               <p>But not for all this, doth God forſake his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:15877:126"/>ſoules; but euen when all humaine counſell, and power failes, then runnes he towards them: with a mightie hand, taking away the cuppe of bitterneſſe, euen from their mouthes, and in exchange thereof, he giues them ten thouſand comforts. And, the while, a man comes to know, that he is weake, by hauing vnderſtood his great miſerie through experience. He knowes alſo, the ſtrength, and malice of his enemies, and procures to fly from them, and leanes cloſer vpon God, whome he findes to be onely able to deliuer him, out of ſuch bitter pangs as thoſe. And thus, out of his former miſeries, he both fetches light, whereby he may eſteeme leſſe of himſelf: and repoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confidence in God; and he learnes to liue with greater caution, and reſeruation, hauing diſcouered the treacheries and malicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the deuill. And we are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count little of this benefitt: becauſe as our true life conſiſtes in knowing, and louing Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God: ſo alſo is it a thing of great moment, if in the ſtrength and vertue of good ſpirituall directions we may haue ſome knowledge of the deuilles wayes. Not to the ende, that we may loue, and honour him, (for that belongs from vs to God) but that we may fly from him, and eſcape from his ſnares; which are diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and knowen by few men, who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that they haue ſome knowledge of God. Nay, therefore we are to make great account of the fruit, which we gather out of theſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:15877:126"/>difficulties: becauſe thus the ſoule growes to gayne experience, in the warre, againſt this ſubtile enemie. And theſe things, and maine others, doth our merciefull lord, draw out of theſe hard encounters, whereby our aduerſarie pretendes to make vs fall. And ſo we make him looſe, that which he hoped to gaine, and we putt a ſcorne vpon him: whilſt we profitt, and purifye our ſoules, by that verie meanes, which he vſed, for the diſaduantage thereof.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15877:130"/>in thoſe other things, wherein, many thinke: that true ſanctity doth conſiſt. And if you aske mee, what thoſe things are, I ſay that they are noe other, then <hi>vertues; the peace of ſoule;</hi> the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen;</hi> yea and euen our lord himſelf.

Not that it is able to make them ill, (for that it cannot doe) but in regard that by cauſing vs to deſire good things, as our owne laſt end, and for loue of our ſelues, wee make our ſelues ill; ſince wee inuert that order, which the <hi>loue of God</hi> preſcribes; which is, to loue that, which is good, and our ſelues withall, for the ſeruice of God, and for his loue, and all this in the ſame manner, and with the ſame meaſure, which is beſt pleaſing to his, Diuine Maieſty.</p>
               <p>The loue of God doth not conſiſt (whatſoeuer we will needes be ſaying) in the deſire of much vertue, noe nor euen of God himſelf, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately done, and with exceſſe of affliction, as wee are wont to deſire other things. For if I be moued for <hi>the loue of God,</hi> to deſire any thing, my maine deſire, to haue that thing, muſt bee to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it, if God will; and how, and when, and to what proportion he will, and not to bee greedy of it for my owne good, but to the end, that the will of God may bee accomplished though his pleaſure were, that my ſoule should remayne
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15877:130"/>without vertue, and that I should neuer enter into heauen. I ſay though his pleaſure should be ſo, for indeede it is not. But, at the leaſt, our will muſt ſoe be lodged, in the will of God; as that it may bee prepared, to <hi>will</hi> any thing, which God <hi>would</hi> haue vs <hi>will,</hi> without any manner of exception. For if our owne <hi>ſelf-loue</hi> bee aliue in vs, that miſcheif is ſo much the wors, and more <hi>inward,</hi> by how much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thing is, which wee deſire. For, in theſe things, as ſeeming to bee very ſafe, a man is wont to extend his appetite as farre as he liſts. And whileſt wee ſay, that wee deſire <hi>the loue of God,</hi> wee are full of <hi>ſelf-loue</hi> which makes vs deſire him, for the <hi>loue of our ſelues,</hi> without any rule or meaſure; whereas, it ought to bee, iuſt the contrary.</p>
               <p>I remember ſome Doctours tell mee, that <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the firſt, whoe committed this ſinne; and how the thing which he deſired, was good namely <hi>felicity,</hi> but that he deſired it not how, nor when, nor in whome, nor for whome, it was fitt that he should haue deſired it, but with an vnbridled appetite, which aymed at his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne priuate good, as any couetous wretch, might deſire much pelfe, or any ambitious man much honour. Certainely, if the ends and rootes of our deſiring one and the ſame thing be different, the thing it ſelf which is materialy deſired, falles out after a ſorte not to be the ſame. But rather (as I ſayd before) the better the thing it ſelf is, the more daungerous is the inordinate deſire
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15877:131"/>thereof. For there is nothing worſe, then for a man to deſire any thing, as his owne <hi>laſt end,</hi> for the <hi>loue of himſelf</hi> This <hi>laſt end</hi> is that <hi>ſoueraigne God of Goods,</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> whoe ought to bee the ayme, and end of all our deſires. And now, if any should ſay (by not vnderſtanding well, what I affirme) that I ſeeme to teach, that wee muſt not be feruent, in deſiring to become more, and more vertuous; but that wee muſt as well leaue all to God, which belong to the ſoule, as that which concernes the body: my anſwere is. That as in theſe exteriour things, wee muſt bee diligent, but not afflict our ſelues with exceſſe of care, and anguish, but muſt putt our ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into the hands of God, and take with patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce whatſoeuer comes: ſo in thoſe things, which importe the ſoule, wee muſt be ſure, to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re diligent: but yet with condition, that if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our diligence, wee cannot haue all wee would, wee muſt not ſuffer our ſelues to growe impatient. For that would be a worſe fault, then the former, which gaue vs ſoe much trouble. But wee muſt conforme our ſelues wholy, to the will of God; to whome humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and patience in the midſt of our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is more pleaſing, then a proud deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and complacence, in the ſtrength which wee conceane our ſelues to haue.</p>
               <p>And if wee cannot obtayne at the hands of God, that wee may liue without faults: yet lett vs render him moſt humble thankes, for hauing giuen vs the knowledge of them. For
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15877:131"/>was perhaps any other thing, the perdition of that proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment,<note place="margin">

And did any thing ſaue the Publicane, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which hee had, of his ill deedes; and the diſpleaſur which he conceiued againſt himſelf for them, deſiring mercy of our Lord? It is not the caſe of euery one, to conſerue humility, in the middeſt of great vertues; but there be very few, whoe are not diſguſted with their owne faultes. And therefore, though the former of theſe two wayes, be higher: yet the later is ſafer. All which is diſpenſed by our God, who is of ſoueraigne wiſedome, and who guides vs by ſeuerall wayes, to the ſame <hi>end,</hi> which is <hi>himſelf.</hi> And though wee be neuer ſo couetous, mee thinks this ought to ſtay our ſtomach with a ſufficiency of comfort; that wee may hope to goe to heauen: whether it be, whith the height, and perfection of vertue, as ſome goe: or by the knowledge of what we want, and doeing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ſame, as many others doe.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, wee muſt not forbeare to imitate the beſt wee ſee: ſince our Lord hath giuen vs a deſire thereof: and ſince an account is to be demaunded of vs, if wee doe it not. Wee muſt therefore deſire, to be better, (ſoe that yet withall wee looſe not our inward peace) though wee obtayne not all wee deſire. For otherwiſe, I doe not thinke that euer there was a man, in the world (leauing him onely aſide, whome euery
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:15877:132"/>body knowes) who deſired not to be better, then he was; but yet this did not take theire peace from them, becauſe they deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of any particular appetite, which neuer confeſſes that it hath enough; but onely for the loue of God, with whoes diſtribution, and portion, they would be well content, though he gaue them leſſe; eſteeming that to bee true loue, which contents it ſelf with what he giues; more then to deſire to haue much; though <hi>ſelf-loue</hi> tell vs, that wee deſire it, but for the ſeruice of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>And for my part I beleiue, that there is noe peace to be had in this world, but by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Nor doe I thinke; that it is true patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, when a man is content to beare, with his neighbours; if withall, he be not content to beare with himſelf. Not to the end, that he muſt fayle to puniſh, and to mend his faultes; but that his hart may not be deiected, and he vnreaſonably afflicted; and that whatſoeuer happen, hee may bee able to keepe himſelf content, both within, and without; but ſoe that yet withall (as I was ſaying) he ſtill doe his diligences, to mend himſelf. Which yet if he ſhould not wholy doe, it is better that he bee ſorry for it, and that inſtantly he riſe vp, with new alacrity; which vſes to encreaſe, and double our ſtrength; then that, whileſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues himſelf to lament his faultes, for the <hi>loue of God,</hi> he ſhould indeed diſpleaſe the ſame God, by ſeruing him with a ſowre kind of hart, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:15877:132"/>with fallen wings, and ſuch other braunches as vſe to riſe from this roote. Let the Concluſion be that, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> deliuers. <hi>Let vs frequent prayer, in all things, giuing thanks to God,</hi>

               <head>A Letter to a Cauallier his freind whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he teacheth how the afflictions which God ſendes to his ſeruants are to put good men in hope and wicked men in feare.</head>
               <p>THankes be giuen to Chriſt our lord for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made you a partaker of paine and trouble for it is the moſt certaine title to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which can be had vpon earth: ſince it doth enable vs to be like our lord who deſcended from heauen to giue vs light that we might loue him, and ſtrength by his example, and grace by his merites. Let not the diſpenſation of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of God ſeeme cruelty in your ſight: for as the rewarde which he giues is not light ſoe neither muſt the meanes be light whereby it is to be obtained. Nor is there any thing further of from being a matter of toyes or ieſt then that <hi>which our lord hath prepared for ſuch as loue him</hi> Now to the end that this may be knowen and rightly vnderſtood it is fitt that they who are to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:15877:133"/>enioy it may be ſoe treated as he was that ſoe the world may be vnbeguiled if it ſtill conceiue that by liuing in ieſt they are to enioy that great reward in earneſt.</p>
               <p>Our lord giues aduiſe to his ſeruants, and he threatens ſuch as will needes be ſtrangers to him. For to the former ſorte of men he ſaith that they muſt thinke highly of his rewarde: ſince he will not giue it but vpon high tearmes. And as for theſe other he askes them how they thinke to eſcape the rigour of his handes, they who are his enemies: ſince euen his children be ſtrictly treated who are yet elected for ſoe great a good. If we caſt our eyes towardes this beame of rigour and iuſtice which are the afflictions whereof we now ſpeak, we shall finde that they conteyne greate occaſions both of hope and feare. And on the one ſide the mercy of God is much glorified thereby and his iuſtice on the other. Let trouble expect to finde repoſe and let him feare affliction hereafter who doth not feele it now. For ſince in any man how iuſt ſoeuer he be there are many thinges which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue punishment though not in hell: (and this punishment is to be perſonally indured if it be not purged with ſoe great an exceſſe of loue as that the contrition may ſtand for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it did in <hi>S. Mary Magdalen</hi> and ſome others) it is plaine that eyther heere or in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory they muſt paſſe <hi>through fire</hi> And though they who finde not in themſelues ſoe great loue of God as to cauſe this greife which may ſtand
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:15877:133"/>for a ſatisfaction, may thinke perhaps that they receiue hard meaſure in beeing ſaued <hi>by fire</hi> whilſt others shall be ſaued without it yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are much deceiued in their account.</p>
               <p>For the great loue of God euen heere on earth when men ſee that God is offended doth cauſe greater greife then that to which you are ſubiect. And that truth is ſeene by this then when one loues God greatly he would be glad of the paine you ſuffer ſoe that he might be free from that which he feeles for the offences which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God. And at this wee muſt not wonder ſince there are perſons who euen to free you from the paine wherein you are would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure themſelues. And this alſo may ſerue for a proofe that the loue which one beares to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puts him to more trouble then the paine it ſelfe would doe which the other feeles: that if your ſelfe loue another very much, you would not be ridd of your owne paine if it were vpon condition that the other muſt indure it for yow; which proues as I was ſaying that it would trouble you more in the perſonne of that other then in your owne.</p>
               <p>Now if the loue of a creature can reach ſoe farre, how much more will the loue of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour be able to doe, it being infuſed by the moſt holy ſpirit of our lord which farre exceedes all other force. And thus it growes to be a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth that eyther in this fashion or in that there is noe meanes to eſcape from ſuffering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ariue to enioying. And tell him who
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:15877:134"/>would complaine of this law ather complaine that he is a man, &amp; that he was not made an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell; and lett him complaine againſt iuſtice and reaſon which doe abſolutely require that vertue muſt be obtained with labour and the reward muſt correſpond with the vertue.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Doe not permitt your heart to ſinke vnder your croſſes but remember that heretofore you haue deſired to doe and ſuffer ſomewhat for the loue of God <hi>God is not deafe to</hi> the deſires of our hartes. He hath giuen that which he knew to be beſt for you; and if you thinke it heauy confide that he who ſendes it, will giue you shoulders wherewith to beare it. That which afflictes will haue an end, and that which giues repoſe will
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:15877:134"/>ſucceed; but the latter will not be like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but incomparably greater. And if you tell me that you will renounce this later vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that you may not endure the former, it is not well ſaid nor doth it become a noble minde which deſires, more to ſee it ſelfe in difficulty &amp; trouble for the obtaining of vertue then to be idle and without exerciſe. Nor is it fitt that you who haue caried ſoe much courage in your hart through theſe warres of the Emperour should haue it faintely affected in the warre of God. We demaund not of you heere that you should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct a whole army like ſome Captaine generall but onely that you traile your pike well &amp; giue a good account of your perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, &amp; of the place where you are put. Be not a coward in the leſſe occaſion whoe are ſoe valiant in the greater.</p>
               <p>Put your ſelfe wholy into the paſſion of our lord and learne thereby how much he endured and how great loue he bore to you; ſince being able to redeeme you by other meanes yet he would not doe it but vpon the price of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue paines and ſorrowes. And ſoe it comes to paſſe that as he in one hower did more loue his father then all mankinde put togeather in all their liues, ſoe in one hower did he paſſe through more bitter ſorrowes then all mankinde; and there was not in the whole liues of them all to be found eyther any <hi>loue</hi> or any <hi>greife</hi> like his.</p>
               <p>Straine your ſelfe to a deſire of enduring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for him. Be not a ſlaue ſince he loues you and treates you as a ſonne For the father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15877:135"/>the ſonne and you may hold your ſelfe for his ſonne ſince he correctes you. Loue your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart from your ſelfe and giue your ſelfe to God. Say to him <hi>I will follow thee though it be by the way of ſorrow I will preſent thee with this ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. I will not giue thee any thing of little value; but that which may coſt me my blood, that ſoe thou mayeſt to me as thou didſt to Abraham, Quia feciſti hanc rem &amp; non peperciſti vnigenito tuo propter me &amp;c.</hi> Now if God take it ſoe well that a man giue his ſonne for the loue of God how much reaſon is it that man should be very gratefull to god for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his ſonne for man. And he onely is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede thankefull for the benefitt who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thereof giues his owne ſonne to god; namely that thing which his hart would moſt be troubled to leaue and this becauſe God will haue it ſoe.</p>
               <p>Conſider the true Originall of loue which God did beare you, but let it be with fetching this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from thence that as they drew blood from him &amp; gaue ſorrowes to him he may giue them to you; and as they gaue him paine ſoe he may giue paine to you. For infallibly if ſoe you shall anſwere to the ſorrowes of God with your ſorrowes he will anſwere to thoſe ſorrowes of yours with ſuch a reward as shal make you eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme your ſelfe happie for hauing endured them.

                  <p>He declares how she is to cary her ſelfe in ſpirituall things; and which is the ſaſeſt way, how to treat with God, and to vſe that gift of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which she had.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE grace and peace of <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt our Lord be euer with you; When I accepted, to read that booke of yours, which was ſent me, it was not ſoe much out of any opinion, that I was able to iudge, of theſe things, which are conteyned therein; as becauſe I thought, that, with the fauour of our lord, my ſelfe might profitt, by them. And I thanke Chriſt, that althought I haue not read it with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which had beene fitt; yet I was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby; &amp; may alſoe be benefitted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the fault be not mine owne. And truly, though I might receiue comfort by reading it, without reflecting vpon it otherwiſe: Yet me thinkes, the reſpect I owe both to the matter it ſelfe, as alſo to the perſon who commendes it vnto me, deſpenſes not with me, in forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſay ſome part of what I thinke thereof: at leaſt, in generall tearmes.</p>
               <p>The booke is not fitt, to come into the hands of many. For the words muſt be reformed in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:15877:136"/>ſome partes thereof, &amp; declared in others. And ſome things may be profitable to your ſpiritt, which would not be ſoe, if they ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by others. For the particular wayes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby God guides ſome, are not fitt for all. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, or the moſt of them, I haue noted downe, and I will putt them into order, as ſoone as I can: &amp; I ſhall eaſily finde meanes to ſend them to you. For if you ſaw my infirmities accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with my other neceſſary imployements; I beleiue they would rather moue you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, then to any accuſation of me for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of your <hi>prayer,</hi> for the moſt part is good: and you may very ſafely beleiue it: and practiſe it, and in your <hi>Raptes,</hi> I finde theſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes which true <hi>Raptes</hi> haue.</p>
               <p>The way of God's teaching a ſoule, without the vſe of the <hi>imagination,</hi> and without eyther <hi>interiour,</hi> or <hi>exteriour wordes,</hi> is very ſafe; I finde nothing therein, wherat to ſtumble: and S. Auguſtine ſpeakes well of it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>interiour</hi> and <hi>exteriour wordes,</hi> haue deceiued many in our times: and the <hi>exteriour</hi> are the leſſe ſafe of the two, To diſcerne, that they proceede not from our owne ſpiritt is an eaſy matter: but to finde whether they grow from a <hi>good ſpiritt,</hi> or from a <hi>bad</hi> is more hard. Men giue many rules, whereby to know if they bee of our Lord: and one of them is, if they be ſpoken in ſome time of great ſpirituall neceſſity: Or if a man profitt much by them,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15877:136"/>whether it be by way of comforting him, when he is in temptation, or deſolation: or for the preuention of any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And conſidering both this, and that the wordes muſt be agreable to holy Scripture, &amp; the doctrine of the Church: I am of opinion that theſe <hi>wordes,</hi> which are mentioned in your <hi>booke,</hi> or the greateſt part of them are of God.</p>
               <p>That, whereof there is more doubt are the <hi>imaginary,</hi> or <hi>corporall viſions,</hi> whereof you ſpeak. Theſe muſt in noe caſe be deſired; and if they come without being deſired, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by other good meanes, we muſt alſo procure to auoyd thoſe thinges.</p>
               <p>But yet, when all this is done, if the <hi>viſions</hi> laſt, and if the ſoule reape profitt by them: and if the ſight thereof induce it not to vanity, but to increaſe of humility; if that which they ſay be agreable to the doctrine of the <hi>Church;</hi> if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue any long time and with that interiour kinde of ſatisfaction, which may better bee felt, then declared; by this time me thinkes, I

               <p>In this which exteriourly may ſeeme to be the wrath of God, wee muſt beleiue his diuine harte, to be moſt peaceable, and his bowells moſt paternall towards vs, nor muſt wee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue according to the feeling of fleſh &amp; bloud, but according to faith, which ouercomes and fooles all ſuch diſcourſe.

For let him who deſires to know, and pleaſe God, not rayſe his eyes, but let him abaſe them, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and not ſifte his iudgments: and that man shall arriue to true knowledge: and shall finde that our lord of power, is entirely ſweete towardes his ſeruants: and doth then endue them with the greateſt bleſſings, when to the eyes of flesh and bloud, hee may ſeeme moſt to haue forſaken them.</p>

He is your Father, though he ſcourge you: be you his daughter, in receiuing his correction, with obedience and giuing of thanks. And if you be in much payne, whilſt you feele the ſcourge, let it be tempered, by conſidering the hand from whence it comes, your beloued he is: and he loues you more, then he is beloued by you. He corrects you with loue: &amp; doe you alſo receiue it with loue, that ſo you may anſwere our lord in the ſame tune, wherein he ſpeakes. He hath a minde to purify you by fire: do not fly of from the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:15877:142"/>whatſoeuer payne it may put you to. For it is better to become pure from the vncleanes of earth, which is ones owne will, and withall to bee broken in pieces; then to be whole otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Sing you thus to our lord,<note place="margin">Pſ. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt tryed my hart and thou haſt viſited mee by night; thou haſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined mee with fire and thou haſt not found wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in mee.</hi> For thus doth God purify his elect; and he who is not proued, and purifyed thus, is noe Sonne, and shall be noe heire of his. And for as much as it is now ſoe long a time, ſince your ladyship hath ſoe fayre euidence, that you are borne to inheritt; procure you to pay with readines, that rent charge, which is layd vpon your land. This inheritance is very rich and glorious, but the heires thereof muſt ſuffer much tribulation in this world. They are to be vntyed, and taken of from the <hi>Croſſe</hi> heere, when they goe vp to raigne there: and men muſt not think of goeing from one pleaſure, to another. The bulls which are of a generous kind goe all darted, and wounded, out of the <hi>Place;</hi> but ſuch as are baſe and cowardly, retourne home, in whole skinnes. Iuſt ſoe is the good Chriſtian, who is to be pierced on all ſides. And when tyrants, and executioners are wanting, they shall haue enough to ſuffer, in theyre owne houſes, by theyre children, theyre huſbands, and theyre freyndes, who will by certayne ſweete, and and ſmooth wayes, torment them worſe then thoſe others.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:15877:142"/>
               <p>It is moſt certaine, that to ſee one ſuffer whome wee loue, is a very knife at our harts: and loue is our executioner; and the more loue there is, ſoe much is the executioner more cruell.

For this <hi>loue,</hi> was the, executioner of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our lord, which putt him to more payne, then all thoſe viſible executioners; and this was the executioner of his bleſſed Mother alſoe, and of as many elect, as God hath had.

Our lord, who ſends you this tribulation, knowes the time which is moſt fitt for comforte, and hee will prouide it for you, when it shall be beſt.

               <p>I Haue beene thinking ſometimes, whither our lord might not ere this haue taken you out of this life, to giue you the fruition of himſelfe. For to be aliue and to remaine ſoe long without letting me know how your ſoule doth, ſeemes to me a kind of incredible thing. Though yet it be true, that our lord ſome times, giues a ſoule ſoe great feeling of himſelfe, that it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers nothing els becauſe it is wholy employed vpon him, who is <hi>all thinges.</hi> I beſeech his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that this may haue beene the cauſe of your ſilence. For then, I shall not onely, not complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but greatly reioyce. For what other thing, can I ſoe well deſire for your ſoule, which in our lord, I loue; as to ſee it all employed, in louing, and in being beloued by him. This is the end, of all the paines which he hath taken with your ſoule, and of all the fauours which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon it.</p>
               <p>Tell me, O ſpouſe of Chriſt our lord, how you doe. Doe you loue him much, and doe you
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15877:143"/>hould him faſt, in your boſome? is you heart euen wounded, with the care you haue, to keepe him content; and to ſeeke his holy will, though it be in contradiction of your owne? For though the loue of our lord, be the ioy, and ſolace of our ſoules; yet, on the other ſide, it ſuffers them not to repoſe; but like a continuall ſpurre, is ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and vrging them on, that ſoe euery day, they may pleaſe him whome they loue, more and more. For this reaſon this <hi>loue,</hi> is compared to fire, which neuer is at reſt; but the liuely flame thereof, is euer working, and ſtriuing vpward. This <hi>loue,</hi> will haue nothing to doe with ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; nor knowes it, how to take any reſt, but in our lord. And this is the <hi>loue,</hi> of a Loyal <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> which, it is reaſon that you be, in <hi>performance,</hi> ſince you are ſoe in <hi>profeſsion;</hi> &amp; ſince, you haue an inward vocation, to put that in practiſe, to which you were called.</p>
               <p>Doe not forgett the <hi>day,</hi> on which you offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your ſelfe to your <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> by the hand of your <hi>Prelatt.</hi> Nor that other day, when your <hi>ſpouſe</hi> conueyed his hand, into your heart, making you vnderſtand both your ſelfe, and him. He ſaid in your ſoule, <hi>let light be made:</hi> and then all darkenes, and ſorrow fled away: and now, like one who ſees the light of heauen, you liue in ioy, becauſe you know which way you may goe, without danger of falling. For if you be carefull to keepe thoſe <hi>dayes</hi> in mind, you will ſee, that by the former of them, you were bound to lodge your loue vpon our lord after a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15877:144"/>very particular manner, becauſe the contract of marriage obliges either partie, to loue the other. And on the ſecond <hi>day</hi> our lord ſhewed the loue which he bore to you; and he gaue you ſtrength to pay according, to your weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the loue which you owe to him. For what haue you out of your owne ſtocke, but obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? and what meanes haue you to pay any thing towards the coming out of debt: you, being a poore ingaged creature; who indeed deſerued to be euer kept <hi>in priſon, in miſerie, and in chaynes,</hi>

               <p>It is not reaſon, I ſay, it is notreaſon, that you ſhould forgett what you owe, nor how God hath enabled you to pay. And for that which God hath giuen you, you are much the more bound to ſerue him. For to be a religious woman is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of many; but to receiue ſoe particular lights, and fauours from heauen, wherewith to ſerue our lord, is the caſe of few. <hi>Abraham,</hi> beſtowed guifts, euen vpon thoſe children which hee had by leſſe principall wiues; but he left his inheritance, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, to the lawfull ſonne of that wife of his, who was moſt beloued; that wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thereby the difference of the guifts
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15877:144"/>of God, which hee imparteth, in this life, to ſeuerall perſons.</p>
               <p>Our lord be thanked, for that your <hi>lines, and lottes, are fallen into the beſt ground;</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muchas grace was giuen yow, whereby to make you <hi>chaunge</hi> your ſtate of life, and to deſpiſe the world with your whole heart, and to deſpiſe alſo your ſelfe; and to obey the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, of your <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> as your mother, and to loue all your ſiſters, and Almighty God, more then the very apples of your eyes. This is that caeleſtiall fauour, which was done you, that you might be rich, and well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all thinges neceſſary, in Chriſt our Lord crucified, and from thence comes this ſoe hopefull and happy change, which you haue made, in the manner of your life, and that inuiſible beauty, wherewith your ſoule is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed.</p>
               <p>And what now remaines, but that you be like one, who hath acquired great worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and who inſtantly entertaines ſeruants, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though he be angry with the defectes of ſuch as haue already knowne him, and will punish them yet he driues not away his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and he giues them correction, not with fury, but with the rod of a Father. Goe you therefore inſtantly to him, though you know you haue offended him, <hi>for</hi> perhaps hee may haue shewed you his anger, to the end that yow should remoue it from him, by your humility, and purpoſe of amendment.

               <p>Take heed you grow not ſtiff, and fixed in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, for this is a diſeaſe very hardly cured. And yet, on the other ſide, you muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, if you be not alwayes in ſoe great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as were fit. For you are but a woman, and noe Angell: you are but weake, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with much ſtrength. The greateſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy you can doe your greateſt enemy, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fallen, in the way (as ſome cripple might be in a ſlough of mire) with the bones as it were, of your ſoule broken through diſtruſt, as if now you had noe more to doe, with the buſines of getting vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>Our lord's pleaſure is, that you should thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke highly of his goodnes: and that he driues them not away, who knowing their owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knes, goe, and ſeeke for ſtrength, and remedy at

And then, knowing by experience, what kinde of thinges we are, we grow to thanke our lord, for that which he is to vs, and from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we deſpiſe our ſelues, &amp; we begin to liue with greater doubt, and care, and feare: leaſt we happen to looſe that, a ſecond time, which had beene loſt by vs, once before.</p>
               <p>Thus doth our moſt wiſe phiſitian, and moſt louing father, draw our cure, out of our very woundes themſelues; and life, out of our death, and he shewes his goodnes, by our wickednes. And though we fight ſometimes, againſt him, with the weapons of ſinne, which giues him prouocation, yet his goodnes ſteps out like a conquerour, and impartes a thouſand millions of benefits to vs.</p>
               <p>Be ſure therefore, that you ſerue this lord, with all the force you haue. And if hitherto you haue done ſoe, giue him thankes for it, and if you haue failed thereof, ſee you retourne to him, with shame, and firme purpoſe of amendment.

And becauſe I deſire all good to you, whether it be in much, or little; I wiſh that you were endewed, with a <hi>Loue of God,</hi> which were both <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>ſweete</hi> alſo, ſince a loue with all theſe qualities, is due to him, to whome wee owe our <hi>loue.</hi> But yet, if he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part that loue alone, which is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> it will be, becauſe he intends to doe vs other ſecret fauours, by meanes which are vnknowen to vs, and to vnty vs from our ſelues, and to exerciſe our vertue, whereof there will bee great neede, for a man whoe treates with him, who is infinitly wiſe and doth extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely like, that noe man ſhould be ſo in his owne eyes.</p>
               <p>Your care muſt therefore bee to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on, according to that ſtrength, which our Lord giues yow; for his grace, will not faile.

               <p>This ignorancy of ours, is an vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kinde of thing; and ſoe is our ſetting our ſelues out, and our ignorant kinde of zeale, to doe good. And wee haue much, and much a doe, to beleiue it, till wee haue bought this knowledge, vpon the price of many errours, which wee ſhall haue committed.

And if I were with you, I could tell you of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge things which haue happened to men, who had beene ſlacke in performing their good exerciſes. Whereby you might perceiue, that our Lord eſteemes it not as any ſmall infirmity, for a man to be a <hi>Lunaticke;</hi> ſometymes doeing his duty, and ſometymes, not. A cleare ſigne it is, of a ſoule in ſubiection to ſelfewill, to doe a thing when the humour ſerues, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, vpon mere humour, to lett it alone. And foraſmuch as ſuch men want the <hi>abnegation of themſelues,</hi> they are in fault, both when they ceaſe from doeing any thing; and ſoe are they alſoe, when they doe it; becauſe they liue, butt in themſelues. And the pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhment, which our Lord inflictes vpon theſe men, is that hee is not liberall of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15877:148"/>himſelfe to them, when they deſire it; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they are not liberall of themſelues to him, when he requires it. Wee muſt therefore be ſure, to aske pardon, for the little conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which wee haue vſed, in the ſeruice of our Lord; and to reforme our ſelues with an entire <hi>reſignation</hi> into his hands, concerning the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our endeauours, whether they be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or leſſe.</p>

And by how much the more, you ſhall be able to liue towards the contenting of him; and to be dead towards the ſeeking of your owne contentment, ſoe much the more happy ſhall you be. Spend not time at all, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whether it were beſt, to accept, or els to refuſe, that buſines, whereof they wrott to you, <hi>that without doubt it would be done.</hi> For this is the ſigne, of a hart not deliuered vp to recollection, and which eaſily is induced to looſe the <hi>preſent tyme,</hi> with care of the <hi>future.</hi> Forget it; and beſeech our Lord, that it may not proue a temptation to you; ſince he knowes your weaknes.</p>

You shall be ſure to haue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailles, and thoſe sharp enough: for our enemies are in great multitude, and full of rage.

If they who watch beſt, haue enough to doe, to defend themſelues; what doe you thinke will become of wrechleſſe perſons, but that they should entirely bee ouercome?</p>
               <p>Remember that the pleaſure which ſinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents is ſmall, filthy, and shorte; and the ſorrow which it leaues behinde is very great, and the miſery which growes to vs thereby, is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater. What ſorrow (how great ſoeuer it be can equal that which wee ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, vpon our loſſe of Almighty God? O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which should make vs tremble, euen in hearing it named! For if we delight in ſinne, we

Let not the vncleanes of the fleſh, nor the vanitie of the world, nor the ſubtility of the deuil, deceiue vs. But let vs behould Chriſt our Lord, vpon the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> and we ſhall ſee him tormented in his body, &amp; diſhonoured by the world, &amp; that ſoe he ſubdued the deuill.</p>
               <p>Who euer looked towards Chriſt our Lord, and was deceiued? Infallibly there was neuer any. Let vs therefore neuer draw our eyes of from him, vnleſſe we meane to turne blinde. Let it neuer ſeeme to him, that wee valew his loue ſoe little; as that, although he died for vs, we cannot find in our harts, ſoe much as to bee looking towards him. For he died for this, that wee by looking vp to him, might ſtriue to dye to our ſinnes. Let therefore our <hi>ould man</hi> die in vs, ſince our <hi>new man,</hi> who is Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, died for vs vpon the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> Let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards his wounds; for by his, wee ſhall be cured of ours. And if wee thinke it a heauy thing, to part from our ſinnes; it was much more hard, and heauy for his ſoule to part from his body, when he died, to the end that wee might euer liue.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore goe on apace, &amp; take hart to follow ſuch a captaine as this; who leades vs the way not onely in <hi>doeing,</hi> but in <hi>ſuffering</hi> Let vs crucifye our fleſh with him, that now wee may noe longer liue according to the deſires of

And ſoe rude ſtones will be to vs, as pretious Iewels; and priſons, will be pallaces; and death it ſelfe, will be conuerted into life. O Ieſus Chriſt, and how ſtrong is that loue of thine? and how truly doth it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert all things to our good as S.

And where the treaſures are certaine, ſince they all conſiſt in enioying him, who alone, ſuffices to enrich his poſſeſſors with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable beatitude.</p>
               <p>But now to the ſeruice, of this God, there are many ſeuerall wayes and ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an affection to one, and ſome to another, euery one according to his inclination.

But Madam, amongſt all the things of this world, wherein our lord may bee pleaſed by vs, let vs make choiſe of <hi>ſuffering</hi> for his loue: for this is both moſt high, and moſt ſafe. And this did the Maiſter of truth, whoe is Chriſt our lord, teach vs, when coming into the world, he princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally exerciſed himſelfe in this, and to this, he hath inuited vs. This is a pointe of ſecuritie, and not a thinge made of duſt, or ſtrawe. For it is not of conformitie with our ſenſualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15877:162"/>but of contrarietie therevnto. And onely the loue of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is able to make affliction ſauour well in our mouthes; and he alone is ſufficient to make vs encounter, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that, which of it ſelfe is vnpleaſant, and driues men from it.</p>
               <p>What did it ſignifie that <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſeeing a ſerpent before him,<note place="margin">

But God commaunded, that he should returne to that, from which he had fled, and not onely returne, towards it, but to take it vp into his hand. And he, obeying the voice of God, founde in thoſe hands, noe more now a ſerpent, to bite him, but a ſtaffe to ſupport him. Thus doth it dayly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to men, who in their afflictions obeying the will of our lord who ſends them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them into their hands, that is to ſay, taking hould of the occaſions which are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and accepting them with obedience, that they finde noe ſuch diſcomfort, or diſquiet, as is wont to weary the ſoule with complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, butt comfort, and ſupport, and ſtrength: Confiding, that ſince God ſendes them tribulations, he will place himſelfe neere about them, according to his promiſe: and that he lodges his loue in them, ſince he

               <p>Madam, you muſt conſider, that that ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth not pleaſe his Maiſter, who hauing beene taught a thing at many ſeuerall tymes, is ſtill as groſſe, and rude, as at the firſt. And that phiſitian growes weary, who findes that he

And ſoe our lord is not pleaſed, that we should ſtill continue in taking the milke of comforts, and delights; but that we should runn nimbly towards him, although it could not be done, without paſſing the pikes: and that the fire of our loue muſt conſume whatſoeuer shall ſtand before vs: ſince there is nothing which it imports vs ſoe much to haue, as <hi>loue;</hi> And this <hi>loue</hi> cannot receiue ſoe good a <hi>proofe,</hi> as by tribulation and paine.</p>
               <p>Now whoſoeuer loues Chriſt our lord, should not deſire to be without ſome tryall, or <hi>proofe,</hi> whether indeede he loue him, yea, or noe.

A great honour it is to ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, in that which much troubles vs; and we cannot yeild a ſeruice to God which pleaſes him better, then when with a very willing hart, we be afflicted for his ſake: and when wee drinke that challice in his company, who drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſo deepely of it, for vs. Vpon this you muſt place your eyes, ſince God is pleaſed to chooſe this meanes, whereby to bring you vp towards him. Doe not turne coward, in fighting the battailes of the generous loue of the celeſtiall kinge; nor hould you any tyme to be well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:15877:164"/>but that, wherein you ſuffer ſomething, for your <hi>beloued,</hi> which alone, ought to giue you comfort, and ground, to thinke that you loue our lord.

For perhaps, if you knew it, you might fall into a greater occaſion, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of vanity, then the ſuſpition you haue of your not being beloued by him, may be of your deſpayre; for without doubt they are fewer who can enioy proſperity, without any mixture of vanity, or inordinate delight, in the ſweet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes which are giuen them: then there are, who can beare, the bitternes of tribulation, without deſpaire.

Yea, and I thinke you ſayd, in ſome one of them, that the peace, and comfort which formerly you had receiued, was entirely retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I anſweared none of thoſe letters, eyther becauſe my ſinnes hindered mee, from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of giuing you comfort; or els becauſe I knew you had ſufficient confidence in mee, without receiuing my anſweares. But now at laſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a letter from you, whereby you tell mee, that you are as much afflicted, as euer, if it be not rather more; and you deſire mee to write.</p>
               <p>I am in paine, through your paine, and this, hath moued mee, to entreate, that for the loue of Chriſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> crucified, you ſuffer not your ſelfe to be blinded by that darknes, which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of ſadnes, is wont to drawe ouer our
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15877:169"/>ſoules, but remember, how faithfull that lord is, to whom you haue offered yourſelfe. And, that it is an vſual thing with his infinit wiſdome, to ſaue the ſoules of his ſeruants, by meanes which they cannot reach to vnderſtand; hiding his loue from them ſometimes: and shewing them a countenance of ſome rigour; and all this, not becauſe he is cruell, but out of pure, and perfect mercye. Becauſe he knowes that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmityes are better cured, when wee are layd vnder the ſcourge of tribulation; then when we are carryed vp in the hands of proſperity and comfort.</p>
               <p>You tell me that deſolation wherein you are, ſeemes very bitter to you, and that you cannot beare the rigour of that angry face of our lord, which you ſay he shewes to you, and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence alſoe from him, wherein you liue. But I tell you, my good ſiſter, that though tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be of as much daunger to you as you declare: yet the ſtate of comfort, is ſtill ſubiect to as much. <hi>Nay, proſperity,</hi> is much more to be feared, then <hi>aduerſity.</hi> For in the former, the ſoule runnes hazard, to depart from God: but in the latter though it ſuffer payne, yet that very payne it ſelfe, incites one to drawe nearer to him. And if you ſay, that the great weight of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, doth ſometimes put the ſoule in daunger of ſinning through impatience, you ſay nothing but truth.

And theſe (how ſoeuer they are not viſible) be yet as great, or greater, then thoſe.

But now, he who diſcomforts, is our Lord, who hides himſelfe; and the Deuils, like cruell executioners, doe by a thouſand deuices, torment the minde, which is farr more ſenſible, then the body. And from that torment, doth many times redound, a torment euen to the very body it ſelfe. And ſoe the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le man, both within and without, is layd vpon the diſcomforts of a <hi>Croſſe</hi> And he ſighes, and grones, and askes ſuccour of our Lord.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:15877:171"/>he compared her to a dog.</p>
               <p>That indeed is an hower, of mighty anguish, when the ſoule findes noe repoſe, in any thing, to which it can apply it ſelfe. As when a man is drowning, in a profound ſea, without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſoe much, as any little reſt for the feete.

By this <hi>Faith,</hi> wee <hi>ſee</hi> that which is inuiſible, how deepe ſoeuer it be hidd. And euen through the midſt of theſe pikes, which are the disfauours of God, (the ſharpe points whereof we feele ſticking in vs) wee yet enter, and paſſe on, into that moſt retired ſecret of the hart of our Lord; and there wee finde, that indeed he loues vs, though hee ſhew vs ſignes, which looke as if they proceeded from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection. And then ſoe wee eſteeme, and vſe them, as wee ought, when we take them for the tryal of our <hi>Faith;</hi> and for the exerciſe of our <hi>Loue;</hi> and for the encreaſe of our <hi>Crowne;</hi> and for <hi>matter,</hi> wherevpon our <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, muſt worcke.</p>
               <p>If you beleiue mee not, I pray you tell me, how shall the chaſt woeman be tryed, but by contradictions, and combates againſt Chaſtity? And how shall your <hi>Faith</hi> be tryed, but by receiuing theſe tokens of disfauour, which pretend to depriue you of confidence.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:15877:173"/>Be not troubled, to finde that your <hi>Spouſe</hi> is thus reſolued, to make tryall of your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to him. For this is a very vſuall thing betweene <hi>Spouſes;</hi> and the fruite thereof vſes to be, but an encreaſe of <hi>loue;</hi> which it is not fit to keepe idle; for in our employment, and exerciſe thereof, doth our life and treaſure conſiſte. And now God made choice of you, to diſcharge this office towardes him. And if indeed you would exerciſe it well, it muſt be by louing him, though you feele not your ſelfe to be beloued by him, and by following him, whome you conceiue to be flying from you. For he who loues not but onely when hee finds himſelfe to be beloued, is indeed noe true louer; but his reſpects, runn all towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And heereby it will appeare, whether you be that true <hi>Cananean</hi> or noe, if when you heare hard language, and be caſt of by our lord; you doe yet importune him; and if following him, who flyes from you; and humbling your ſelf to him, who treats you noe better, then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me baſe, vnre aſonable creature, you doe yet proceede to loue him, as ſincerely, and purely, as if you taſted of great delights, and Regalos, at his hands. For in the end, hee will anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you thus, <hi>O woeman, greate is thy faith, let that be done which thou deſireſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the meane time be you reſolute, in continuing faith full; and ſay to him with your whole hart, <hi>O Lord I will loue thee, though thou shouldeſt not loue me. I will ſeeke thee, and looke
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:15877:173"/>chearfully towards thee, though thou flye from me. Let me loue thee ſtill: vpon that condition, doe with me what thou wilt.</hi> By this meanes, the disfauours of our lord, shall be conuerted, into the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of true <hi>loue:</hi> and herein you are to remaine more contented; then you are to be in paine, for being disfauoured. Nor shall you onely pleaſe our lord by this meanes, but more ouer you will obtaine a crowne in heauen, which will be ſtraungely greate. For by the <hi>meaſure</hi> of your <hi>diſcomforts,</hi> that <hi>robe of glory,</hi> is to bee cut out, wherewith you muſt be veſted, in heauen: and <hi>from the ſeede of teares, we muſt gather the shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of ioy.</hi> And we are not to be crowned, for hauing beene in deuotion, and conſolation; but for hauing beene (as it were) threshed with variety of temptations, and for hauing beene content, with the taſte of ſuch gall, as carried the very image of hell with it, and of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof: and for bearing all theſe things, with an equall minde, and for beleiuing that they are light, and few,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> in compariſon <hi>of that ſuperexcellent weight of glory, which is to be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them,</hi> who shall be humbled, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed after this manner. And wee muſt thinke our ſelues happy, in being obedient to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of our lord God, not onely, in that which giues vs guſt, but in the contrary alſoe. For otherwiſe, what wonder is it, to ſee the <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> obey her <hi>fellow ſpouſe,</hi> in that, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues contentment to her ſelfe: ſince for that, there is noe greate neede of <hi>loue:</hi> for the reſpect
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:15877:174"/>of proper intereſt is able to breed ſuch <hi>obedience</hi> as that. Nor doe I know, with what eyes, Chriſt our lord will looke vpon ſuch a <hi>ſpouſe</hi> as that: ſince he obeyed his <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</note> for her ſake, in caſes of ſoe extreame affliction, ſaying: <hi>Let it be, not as I wil, but as thou wilt.</hi> Whereas shee ſaith, iuſt the contrary; <hi>Not as thou wilt, but as I will:</hi> for shee will be ſquared out by another rule, then her <hi>head</hi> was: and will needs make <hi>the will of God,</hi> which is eternally good, to be crocked, that it may conforme it ſelfe to her will: which ſeekes not that which is truly good for her, and which eternally is to be ſoe but that which ſeemes likely, to giue her, ſome little temporall delight.</p>
               <p>A wake O Virgin, out of that ſleepe, wherein you are: for it is broad day. Take the <hi>sheild of Faith,</hi>

And turne your complaint backe vpon yourſelf ſince a little preſent disfauour, is of more power, towards the drawing you downe; then the many fauours, which are paſt, to keepe you faſt on foot. You now, doe iuſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of what you should. For whereas it were reaſon, that in this time of tribulation, you should remember your comforts of former ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: beleiuing, that the trouble which now you haue, is but to trye, what proportion of truſt, you repoſe in God: You doe yet call it into queſtion, whether his loue were true to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:15877:174"/>you then, or noe: beleiuing rather in the shew, and leafe, then in the ſubſtance, and roote,</p>
               <p>You haue noe iuſt cauſe to be diſmayed, though you bee afflicted. For our lord is nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne from you: but he went away, with a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely to ſtande by, and to ſee how you carried yourſelfe, like a mother who hides her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe behind a hanging, to obſerue, and heare, what her childe ſayth, and doth: whilſt he thinkes that he hath loſt her, but then shortly shee ſteps out and makes much of him.</p>
               <p>If you feare, that he hath forſaken you, and giuen you a <hi>bill of ſeparation,</hi> for the faults, and ignorances, into which you may haue fallen, you are much deceiued. For in farr greater falls then thoſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3.</note> his courſe hath beene to comfort ſoules, by ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt committed fornication with many louers: but yet retourne to me, and I will receiue thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though God like well, that his ſeruants should know, and weigh the faults, into which they fall; yet it is not his pleaſure, that they should be diſmayed, or too exceſſiuely affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them. Nay he eſteemes this, to be of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re diſſeruice to him, then the very fall it ſelfe. Neither is it alſoe his pleaſure, that a ſinne which is as little as a graine of ſeede, should be made by vs, as bigg as an Elephant, and much leſſe, that we should make that to be a ſinne, wich indeed is none. Soe that if you haue not fallen into ſinne, and yet will needs be troubled, as if you had, you offend againſt his truth, And
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:15877:175"/>if you had fallen, you should offend againſt his <hi>mercye,</hi> by not beleiuing, that he hath pardoned you. You offend alſoe againſt his <hi>loue</hi> by ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, that he hath forgotten you. And laſtly, you offend againſt the <hi>Croſſes,</hi> which he hath ſent to you, eſteeming them to be meſſengers, and ſignes of wrath, whereas indeed, they are effects of his goodnes.</p>
               <p>Take therefore the courage, now at laſt, to ſally out, from the owne narrow thought; &amp; beleiue of God, according to his goodnes; as it imports his honour, that you should doe. And liue not ſtill, in ſuch blindnes, as to meaſure the large hand of God, by the rules of your owne poore woefull hart. Nor conceiue you, that now he will be a rigorous iudge, who, at others times, and in your greateſt occaſions, hath beene, a moſt indulgent Father to you.</p>
               <p>It was not you vpon whome he looked, when he pardoned you, and called you; but he regarded his owne <hi>blood,</hi> which he ſhedd. Nor doth he now, ſtand hanging vpon your handes, as if he loued you, for them; but you are placed, and <hi>written in his,</hi> as he ſayth, by his Prophet <hi>Iſay.</hi> And in thoſe handes, he loues you; and with thoſe handes he guards you, euen then, when you thinke he giues you buffets. But it is his mercye, which is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye, and ſafety, and noe meritt of your owne. You are a Daughter, and you are to poſſeſſe heauen, by way of inheritance, and not, as a meere day labourer. Confide in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:15877:175"/>God; and giue him glory, in that he lodges his eyes, vpon ſoe vnworthy a thing as you; and for that he purpoſes, to exalt ſoe baſe a creature, to ſuch height of glory. And know, that he hath noe neede of anything, in you; and that if he deſire anything, it is, but that you may offer him that ſacrifice of praiſe for your owne good; confeſſing him to be your gratious <hi>pardoner</hi> and your piteous <hi>rayſer</hi> vp, from your falls; and your <hi>Centinell</hi> who neuer ſleepes when there is queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eyther of doeing you fauours, or of drawing <hi>good</hi> out of your <hi>ſinnes;</hi> and your moſt wiſe <hi>conductour,</hi> who carries, and ſaues you, by ſuch pathes, as ſeeme, in the eye of your ignoraunce to be very farr about, or rather quite out of the way. And all this, he doth, through his owne goodnes alone, conſidering what <hi>himſelfe</hi> is. Which carries a greater weight towards your ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then your wickednes doth, towards your condemnation; and you are bound to beleiue that ſoe it is. And it muſt not ſeeme ſtraunge to you, that the <hi>greater,</hi> ſurmounts the <hi>leſſe:</hi> and the <hi>Creatour,</hi> the <hi>creature.</hi> But let it ſtand for the laſt concluſion, that as noe goodnes in you, was the cauſe, why God loued, and called you to his ſeruice; ſoe will he take care, that your wickednes, and weakenes, ſhall not hinder the courſe of thoſe mercies, which he reſolues to ſhew you, for all eternity. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your <hi>Communions;</hi> and, I beſeech our Lord to giue them his benediction. For my part, I

               <p>AS ſoone as I receiued your letter, I offe red thankes to our Lord, for hauing giuen you a ſigne, that your vocation came from his hand, and this ſigne is, that you haue ſuffered tribulation. You muſt not be a little gladd of this, ſince our Lord loues you. Nor yet muſt you be ſlacke, ſince you are in the middeſt of many dangers; but carry your eye towards him, who hath called you with ſo great loue. You muſt alſoe haue a ſtronge harte, For he called you not with intention to giue you ouer in the middeſt of your iourney; but to guide you vnder the protection of his owne wings, till he may haue conducted you to heauen, where you ſhall ſee his face. Let not the faith of Chriſt our Lord, nor the loue you owe him ſleepe in you; for he neuer ſleepes when there is queſtion of doeing you any good.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:15877:176"/>
               <p>Theſe are tokens which he vſes to ſend, to whome he loues, to try if they alſoe loue him, in their afflictions, and if they confide in him in their dangers: That Spouſe is not worthy of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, who loues her fellow ſpouſe, but onely when he is preſent with her; not doth it coſt him much to confide in him when she findes her ſelfe regaled by him. But the matter is, that when he abſents himſelfe from her, yea and when he ſeemes to haue forgotten her, she muſt loue him ſoe much the better, as he is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſent from her, and confide in him ſoe much the more; as she hath fewer exteriour ſignes of his fauour.</p>
               <p>It is enough for you, my good ſiſter, to haue knowne already by experience, how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our Lord hath beene to you; by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing drawne you to the knowledge of himſelf. And be you, not crauing new teſtimonies of his Loue, but making your ſelfe ſure enough thereof, and be not troubled though he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you; and though it ſeeme, as if he eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe from you and forgott you; but rather ſay thus; <hi>Hee hath a minde to trye me, and not to oppreſſe mee.</hi> You muſt loue our Lord, though he correct you, you muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide in him, though you feele noe comfort from him. Seeke him, though he hide himſelfe; ſuffer him not to reſt, till you haue waked him, and till he confeſſe that you are faithfull in his abſence. And thus you ſhall finde him returne to you, with ſoe much aduantage, as that when you
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:15877:177"/>enioye his preſence againe, you will eſteeme your former afflictions well imployed.</p>
               <p>Procure greate courage, wherewith to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for after the rate of your ſorrows, ſhall your comforts be. Bee not a louer of your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, but be a louer of God; looſe yourſelfe, and ſoe you ſhall be ſure to finde your ſelfe. And if once you would but truſt God home; and if once you would offer your ſelfe to him, with true loue there could nothing happen which would fright you. All bitter froſen afflictions proceede but from diſtruſt in God. And for this our Lord ſaid, <hi>Let not your harts be troubled, and doe not feare. You beleiue in God, beleiue alſoe in mee.</hi> Soe that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>loue</hi> is the cauſe of peace,<note place="margin">

He gaue his word to <hi>S. Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, S. Agnes, S. Barbara,</hi> and <hi>S. Lucy,</hi> and to innumerable other Lady virgins; and tell me now, how completely he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it. They had the courage to deſpiſe,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:15877:179"/>the poore preſent world: and you ſee that now, they raigne with God. They liued heere in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and they are nowe in the eternitie of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. Through how many combatts did they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and they now enioye the euerlaſting crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their conqueſts. They fled from <hi>ſpouſes</hi> of the earth, and they brought the king of heauen, to be in loue with them.</p>
               <p>If they had followed the trace, of this world, their delight had bene already paſſed: and their memories would haue bene forgotten. But they loued that, which was eternall, and therefore their felicitie shall not dye: and their memory shall not decay. They were written in the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of God; and therefore neither water nor winde, nor fyre nor tyme, can make them waſte; For that booke is incorruptible and ſoe in the name which is written in it.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore procure to haue a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge heart towards God, who is your ſaluation, and doe not thinke that he ſells heauen deere to you, for you haue not yet shed your bloud for him, as thoſe others shed theirs. Our lord treates you, like a weake creature; and you should be ashamed to haue giuen him ſuch cauſe. If you had had more faith, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, and more loue to ſuffer for him, he would haue procured you more afflictions; to the end that you might haue purchaſed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Crownes. Doe not content your ſelfe with ſuffering little, conſidering how great your rewards all bee: and how much Chriſt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15877:180"/>our Lord ſuffered for you. He gaue his life for you, and he was deepely tormented and deſpiſed. How then come you thus to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the touch of a flye? doe but loue, and you will deſire to ſuffer. Let your loue be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and you will ſuffer ſorrowes which are doubled. The loue of our lord, makes ſuch as poſſeſſe it, more greedy of ſuffering, then the loue of ones ſelfe, of repoſing. It makes that any burden weighes light, for loue is ſtronger then death. He who loues not, groanes vnder the burden, like ſome laſy beaſt; but he who loues runnes, and flyes; and it ſuffers him not to feele the weight euen of his owne body, nor of whatſoeuer els they can lay vpon it.</p>
               <p>It is not my good ſiſter, that the afflictions which wee ſuffer are greater; but that our loue is little. The weight of a pound is noe great weight; but yet lay it vpon ſome little childe, and he will ſay, <hi>O how heauy it weighes?</hi> Whereas if a man tooke it vp, he would ſcarce feele it. And ſoe take you it, for a ſigne, that if you loue little your afflictions will weigh heauy vpon you; but if you loue much you will ſcarce allowe them to be afflictions. For you will be ſoe inebriated with loue, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be able to diſtract you, from the taſte thereof. You will finde a good ſauour in the very ſuffering, it ſelfe; <hi>and you will draw water,</hi>

               <p>And now if it concerne euery one of vs to loue him, how much more doth it import that ſhe doe it, whome he hath choſen for his <hi>ſpouſe.</hi> It becomes the <hi>ſeruant</hi> to feare his <hi>Maiſter;</hi> and the <hi>ſonne</hi> to honour his <hi>father,</hi> but the <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> to loue her fellow <hi>ſpouſe.</hi> See you loue our lord, and take noe reſt till he haue graunted you this guift.

It is the propertie of ill natured and ill mannered ſeruants to valew their Maiſters at a leſſe rate for vouchſafeing to deſcend and become familier with them, then if they had liued which them like lords. But they whoe liue in true light eſteeme that lord ſoe much the more, as he doth more vouchſafe to diminiſh himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The true loue of Chriſt our lord carries this badge with it, in token that it is indeede of him; That as it apprehends, and highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the goodnes of God, ſoe it alſoe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, and profoundly diſeſteemes, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of man. Therefore loue, adore and

               </argument>
               <p>RIght Reuerend Father, I haue receiued your letter, which hath wrought in me the ſame effect, with thoſe others which formerly I had from you; Namely <hi>rendering of thankes</hi> to our lord, for the guifts which he hath beſtowed vpon you, according to the teſtimony which your words giue, of that which dwells in your heart. It wrought alſo great confuſion in me, to ſee you call me the <hi>Maiſter,</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> of him, to whome I should thinke it a great fauour of our lord, if I could deſerue to be a <hi>Sonne,</hi> and a <hi>Diſciple.</hi> And eſpecially I was confounded, yea and put to paine, to heare you ſay in the end of your letter, that you would haue written me many, if it had not beene for the <hi>Decorum,</hi> which you thought your ſelf bound to keepe, of an <hi>Auditour,</hi> and a <hi>Scholler.</hi> This is not a courſe wherein you muſt proceed with me; for there is noe reaſon that you should put me to loſſe,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:15877:182"/>onely becauſe I deſire, to ſerue and profitt you. And if you treat me in this manner, you will make me heare, and hold my peace.</p>
               <p>I know not, if I wrote not to you the other day, of an errour, which I haue diſcouered in ſome, who yet hold themſelues to be ſpirituall. And it is, that they deſpiſe, the corporall affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and troubles, which are vndertaken, for the loue of our lord. If I wrote to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there wilbe nothing loſt, though I ſay it ouer againe; and if not, it is neceſſary, that I write it.</p>
               <p>Since, that light of our eyes, Chriſt our lord, liued in this world, vnder ſoe many afflictions, and died with ſoe many torments, his ſeruants remaine ſoe hungry, of ſuffering ſomewhat, that it exceedes the appetite wherewith men of this world, runne after eaſe. And not onely are they content to ſuffer affliction, when it comes vpon them, (and much more that kind of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which may be neceſſary to them for the auoyding of ſinne) but they ſeeke it out, by all the wayes they can, and ſoe they make proofe thereby, of the loue they beare to Chriſt our lord, conſidering how he was in ſoe much pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the afflictions which he endured, for the loue of vs.</p>
               <p>For, as the faint and tepid kind of man, would of himſelfe be glad to ſuffer noe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but yet he beares them with patience when they come, leaſt otherwiſe he may offend our lord; ſoe the feruent louer of Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:15877:183"/>would faine take noe eaſe at all; and if perforce he muſt take any, he endures it, but with patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, becauſe ſoe Chriſt our lord, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. In ſuch ſort that as he who is but ſlack, in the ſeruice of God, hath delight and eaſe in his deſire, and takes affliction but with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſoe the true Chriſtian is but patient to ſee himſelf at eaſe, and hath affliction, in his deſire.</p>
               <p>This growes from the ſpiritt of Chriſt our lord; and when this is perfect in a ſoule, it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes that, which it wrought in him: which was a loue of affliction for vs, the better to shew vs his loue. And therevpon it alſo followes, that when men would comfort one who is but ſlack and negligent, vpon the arriuall of any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they muſt doe it iuſt ſoe, as they would comfort a good Chriſtian, when he happens to be in repoſe and eaſe. For the one of them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers eaſe which he loues not, and iuſt ſoe, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſufferred by the other. Now this is part of that, which Chriſt our lord deliuered, when he commaunded vs, <hi>to take vp the Croſſe, if we meant to be his diſciples.</hi> I ſay it is a part thereof: for the other, and chiefe part whereof this <hi>Croſſe</hi> conſiſtes, is the mortification, and death of our ſelf conceyt, and will; and of our paſſions and powers.</p>
               <p>This is that <hi>old man,</hi> who muſt die, as Chriſt our lord died vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> what is this old man? the <hi>body,</hi> which is paſſible and mortall; and that other inward man, whereof I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:15877:183"/>before, muſt be alſo dead in vs.</p>
               <p>But although this be the cheife part of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> we muſt not put away that other part, howſoeuer it be leſſe principall then this. And though S. Paul ſay,<note place="margin">Timoth</note>

                  <hi>Qui Chriſti ſunt, carnem ſuam crucifixerunt.</hi> And if he had meant this onely, <hi>of crucifing the affections,</hi> it had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to ſay, <hi>Cum vitiis &amp; concupiſcentiis,</hi> but by ſaying <hi>carnem,</hi> it proues, that he meant <hi>afflictions of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he explicates very well, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> where, amongſt other things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> wherein men were to exerciſe themſelues, he reckens vp corporall afflictions, namely faſting and watching, ſo that the whole man, muſt

               <p>I haue ſaid thus much, that you may take a ſcantling, of thoſe forces, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you, and that ſoe you may imploy them, vpon doeing, and ſuffering, all you can. And this, not onely conſidering that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to ſome other good intention, but euen though it be for noe other reaſon, let it be done, to the end that you may be in conformity with Chriſt our lord as he was afflicted; and not vpon neceſſity, but for loue.

               <p>There are men, who offer themſelues to the loſſe of their liues in ſome warr for ſlight cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and shall wee be ſoe deſtitute of courage: as not to giue our-ſelues to God? he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for vs, into the hands of thoſe baſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners: and shall not wee aduenture to putt our-ſelues into his? He did it, that he might die: and wee are to doe it, that wee may liue.</p>
               <p>I would not haue your lordſhipp to be ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly herein, but make now this account. There is a God; and for that miſery, which he hath endured for mee; and for thoſe ſinnes which he hath forgiuen mee, and for thoſe bleſſings which he hath vouchſafed mee; I owe my ſelf to him, three thouſand times ouer. If hitherto I haue not giuen him, the entire do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer my ſelf, I am ſorry for it. From this inſtant I giue my ſelf free; and without any impediment, or obligation otherwiſe; that he may treate me wholy, according to his will; and that mine, may ſubmitt it ſelf, to his, as well in the doeing of any thing which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, by his holy lawe: as in the ſuffering of any affliction, which he shall either conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or add to mee. Where can I be kept bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then in the hands of God, into which I putt my ſelf? ſince he ſuffers not his creatures to be loſt: and was content to looſe his life, that I might be enabled to doe this. He would not
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:15877:186"/>aske it of mee, if he did not like it: and he would not take pleaſure in itt, if he did not deſire it. For it is not a proceeding for God to vſe, to deſire vs to giue him that, which he hath noe mind to receiue, any more, then it is his cuſtome, to commaund that wee aske, and yet he forbeare to giue. And ſince he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his deare will to vs, wherewith he deſires our good, and conſequently that wee may bee his: let vs not doubt to belciue, but that he, (who is ſo carefull to demaund, and he who demaunds with the menace of hell, if it be not graunted, and with promiſe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen if it be) will not be ſlacke in receiuing that very thing, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds.</p>
               <p>Let it not ſeeme to your Lordship, that the ſinnes of your former life, ought to diuert you, from this amorous embracement of Almighty God: ſince he ſtands crying out to a ſinner, with his armes all open, and ſince he doth ſo, before the ſinner calles on him. For thus he ſaith. <hi>Fornicata es cum amatoribus multis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem 3.</note> 
                  <hi>tamen reuertere ad me, &amp; ego ſuſcipiam te. Thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with many louers: but yet returne to mee, and I will receiue thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The shepheard will not eaſily be weary in ſeeking his loſt sheepe, nor the falkoner in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to recouer his hauke; and when he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des her, he takes her: and returnes home, with much ioy.</p>
               <p>I ſay this, becauſe by what I conceiue of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:15877:187"/>your lordship, you are endewed with a greater meaſure <hi>of the knowledge of your ſelf, then of the knowledge of God:</hi> and therefore, that you will be more ſubiect to <hi>feare,</hi> then to <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> I wish you not to retract the ill opinion you haue of your ſelfe: confeſſe, and beleiue, that you haue cauſe: and doe not ſeeke to remoue your feare, with falſe hopes, and lyes: to diminish your miſeryes, by that meanes. This would not indeed proue any diminution, but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one miſcheif, vpon the backe of another, and the latter, would be worſe then the former; and an impediment, in ſteed of a remedy: ſince God neuer graunts his pardon and mercy, but to ſuch a one, as vnderſtands his owne miſerie.</p>
               <p>But beleiue, that as wee are more wicked, then wee can arriue to knowe: ſoe is God more good, then wee can poſſibly imagine. Another kind of hart hath he, then wee conceiue, and eſpecially in pardoning: which men knowe very ill how to doe, becauſe they knowe not well how to loue. And from hence it growes, that they are not able to reach, to that height of mercy, which God vouchſafes to ſinners. For as they know nothing by experience of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but anger, againſt ſuch as offend them (and if they pardon, there yet remaynes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reliques of the diſguſt, and withall a great cooling of theyre loue) therfore doe they iudge of God, as they would doe of themſelues; and if they ſay with theyre mouths, that there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene God and man, and that they
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:15877:187"/>forgiue as well as they can, yet theyr harts doe not beate to the ſame time. When your lordships ſonnes shall bee more growne, and shall haue giuen you ſome diſguſts; you will haue had ſome ſent, and taſte of this.</p>
               <p>The father doth not vnloue the ſonne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that ſonne make him angry; but he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectes him, and ſtill carries the hart of a father towards him. And ſoe is our lord wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede; and whenſoeuer the ſinner hath a mind to returne to him, he refuſes not to receiue him into his paternall hart.</p>
               <p>Yea and euen when he retournes not, he is deſiring that he would retourne: and all his ſinnes are not able to quench this deſire in him, fort his <hi>loue</hi> is that which ſtill exceeds.</p>
               <p>Now wee gayne this loue, and this retreate, in to the hart of God, by him, who is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour betweene God, and men <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our lord. Who being the naturall ſonne, did gayne the adoption of ſonnes for vs: and that God should haue the hart of a father towards vs, his ſonnes; whenſoeuer wee would diſpoſe our ſelues to enioy this benefitt, by meanes of <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> This loue, is as the roote, from whence it proceedes, that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God is content to expect vs, to call vs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, to pardon vs, and to ſaue vs. For if wee conſider well, the hart, and loue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this fauour is done vs; it will enamour vs, and oblige vs more to him, then the fauour it ſelf, which he affordes, what a thing is it, that
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:15877:188"/>God doth ſoe much loue man, as through the much loue he beares him, and notwithſtanding the great offences which man committes againſt him, he yet doth not take this loue from him; nor doth it euer make him ſay, <hi>I will loue ſuch a one noe more, though he come to mee agayne: I will not ſeeke him out, nor will I ſend to entreate him; that he may retourne to my houſe.</hi> He ſaith noe ſuch thing as this. But that perſeuering loue, doth ſtill burne with a liuely flame; and this ſoe very clearely, that as theſe great waters of his torments, could not ſoe quench them, as to make him forbeare to dye for vs: ſoe neither can the much greater waters of our ſinnes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish this enflamed charity of God towards vs. But it remaynes euer conquerour, both in his paynes, and in our offences: ſuſſering there, and forgiuing heere. Hee who shall wonder at this, will haue reaſon. For it would be a wonderfull thing, if this kind of loue were shewed, euen from an inferiour, to a ſuperiour; or at the moſt, from but an equall, to an equall. Butt now, this loue from God to man, is more then wonderfull. And yet, on the other ſide, he who shall not beleiue it, in reſpect that it is ſo ſtraunge a thing, putts a great affront vpon Almighty God, ſince he beleiues it not, becauſe it is ſoe wonderfull a worke.</p>
               <p>Whereas, on the other ſide it is as cleare way whereby to knowe the workes of God; if they be ſoe great, as to make ſuch wonder,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:15877:188"/>as know them. For if he be wonderfull, his workes are alſo to be ſoe. And if the reſte of his workes be wonderfull, theſe of his loue, are wonderfull in the higheſt degree: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſpring, out of his goodnes: in the manifeſtation whereof, he takes more delight, and glory, and vſes it more, then in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the other attributes.

               </argument>
               <p>MAdam I haue vnderſtood, that you are ſick, and I am not ſory for it. For if it come to you through any exceſſe of pennance, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is well employed, and if you be ſick vpon noe other reaſon but onely becauſe our lord ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des it to you, let vs bid it welcome in a good houre, as being a part of his <hi>Croſſe.</hi> And though in ſome reſpect, your paine puttes me to paine, as our lord knowes, yet on the other ſide, I am glad of it, becauſe I cleary diſcerne the profits which will be made vpon this occaſion, by one whome I ſoe much deſire to ſee improued. They are not comforts which I wish to my children, but they are corrections; the time of comfort comes afterward. For the preſent, take not your eyes from of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> nor your heart from him who placed you on it. Giue not ouer till you fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that ſufferance is of a ſweet taſte, for that is the true touch of loue. Take noe compaſſion vpon your ſelfe, for there are both in heauen and earth, who haue compaſſion on you, from
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:15877:190"/>their very hearts, and that which is laid on you was very well conſidered of before; and it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the handes of one; who loues you with moſt perfect loue.</p>
               <p>Let not your faith grow weake in theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and dangers, nor your loue by the feeling of theſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: when the fire is great, the winde doth not onely not quench it, but inflame it. And ſoe when a ſoule loues God but in ieſt, any little blaſt of aire puts it out, as it would doe a candle. But true loue growes vp in affliction, for it applies more ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to endure, the more weight, it ſees co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towardes it. And becauſe that loue is of God, it conquers affliction: and noe water could ſerue to quench that fire, which comes downe from heauen.</p>
               <p>Our lord called you, that you might loue him, and this loue is noe ſuch thing as muſt giue you reaſon to regale your ſelfe. But you muſt abhorre your ſelfe for the loue of Chriſt our lord, and denye your ſelfe, to confeſſe him: and be cruell to your ſelfe, that you may be ſweet and acceptable to his diuine Maieſty. If you loue and deſire to enioy your ſelfe, you muſt reſolue to looſe your ſelfe. If you deſire to ſee the face of God, you muſt paſſe towardes him through the pikes. If you care to lodge him in your hart, caſt your ſelfe away, with all other creatures vpon him. Our lord will haue you all alone, and all afflicted, not for any ill will he beares you, but becauſe ſince his owne
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:15877:191"/>naturall ſonne, was ſoe afflicted, he likes not to ſee his adopted ſonnes apparrelled with any other liuery then that. There is nothing ſoe beautifull in his ſight, as to ſee the image of his onely begotten ſonne in vs. And as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vpon which a ſoule can ſoe gladly looke, as vpon our lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> being tormented for loue of vs vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and the more afflicted and deformed we ſee him there, the more beautifull he ſeemes to vs, ſoe the more wee ſuffer for God, the more beautifull wee shall ſeeme to him.</p>
               <p>Nor is it much, that a ſoule which deſires to ſeeme handſome in the ſight of God, should adorne it ſelfe with ſuch curious cleanſing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as may enamour his diuine Maieſty by his ſeeing her, ſince the women of the world doe many thinges which put them to no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and charge, ſoe that they may content the ſonnes of men. Madam we muſt caſt our skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, before we shall be pleaſing to Almighty God. Gould is purified by fire, and the terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part being conſumed, it comes reſplendent from the Crucible.</p>
               <p>Let vs be ashamed of being ſoe weake, in a buſines which is ſoe great, as to import the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Almighty God: and if we vnderſtood this poynt well indeed, we should get heart euen to shed our blood for him, that ſoe we might appeare fairer in his ſight.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:15877:191"/>ſay, Pardon me, O lord, pardon me I beſeech thee: for the curious dreſſing, which this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, beſtowes vpon her ſelfe in this one day, to pleaſe the eyes of the world, ouerſtrips all the paines which I haue taken many yeares for the pleaſing of thine.</p>
               <p>Soe that, my good lady, this entrepriſe of loue is noe matter of wordes, but of ſorrow, of bitter torments, of the dishonour of the world, of being abandoned by the creatures thereof, &amp; ſometimes euen of the ſeeming abſence from the protection of the Creatour. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this a man muſt cary a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and not be ſubiect to complaintes, or deiection of heart: but he muſt reſemble that Martyr, whoſe bowels they drew out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and whoſe flesh they tore from his bones, with iron combes: and yet there ſounded noe word out of his mouth but the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> nor was there any thing in his hart, but <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> togeather with a purpoſe to endure yet more, if God should diſpoſe himſelfe to ſend it.</p>
               <p>To ſuffer for Chriſt our lord, is great glory, and God impartes not that, but to ſuch a one, as whome he loues much. A great mercy it is to giue a guilty perſon fillips, and to releaſe thoſe ſcourges, which were his dew, and if that wherein we ſtand obliged to the iuſtice of God, may be ſatisfied by what we can ſuffer heere, in the name of God let vs fall to worke, and let vs pay whatſoeuer his diuine Maieſty will impoſe, ſoe that being gone from hence, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

Let vs labour in this banishment of ours; for inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the end thereof, we ſhall be landed in our owne country. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>that he wrongs a Martyr who prayes for him when he is dead</hi> for Martyrdome makes a ſoule fly ſtreyght vp to heauen. Let vs therefore labour to be Martyrs by our patience in affliction, for though our perſecution be not ſoe greiuous as theirs was for the time, yet it laſtes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And we ſhould indeed deſire, that this life might not be too recreatiue, but a meere Martyrdome. For ſuch was the life of our Lord, and ſuch doth hee deſire that ours ſhould be.</p>
               <p>There haue beene many martyrs for the faith of Chriſt our Lord, but in fine many are gone to heauen, who were not ſoe. But we all muſt be the Martyrs of loue, if we meane to goe thither. This loue muſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vs, and put vs to paine, both becauſe our ſelues offend God, as alſo becauſe others doe it. This loue muſt depriue vs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, and muſt load our ſhoulders with a <hi>Croſſe.</hi> This loue muſt make vs firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace affliction, and then paſſe ouer it, in the flame which was kindled by our loue of God. This makes vs endure dishonours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling them as wine doth a drunkard. This loue is in this, like all other loue, that whoſoeuer poſſeſſes it ſeekes not himſelf but his beloued, who in our caſe, is God alone and

               <p>A man cannot eaſily feele the force of loue, wherewith it torments heere, nor that wherewith it comforts afterwarde. Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue it, ſince God hath ſaid, it; and let vs walke on in the faith, which we haue in his words; for we haue yet a long way to make. Chooſe which you had rather haue, eyther long afflictions, or els very great ones, for noe man can ſcape ſuffering much, eyther in one fashion or another. Be not ſorry for this, for if God giue you much affliction, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your many ſinnes deſerue it; and ſoe you are to make your payment heere, and I beſeech our Lord that you may doe ſoe. For if I should dye, before you want to Purgatory, perhaps you might want a freind whoe would carry ſoe much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to your ſoule as my felf; and would take ſoe much care to free it, and if you dye firſt, I ſhall haue paine enough, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of you.</p>
               <p>Excuſe mee, for it is not fitt, that eyther you or I, ſhould haue an eye to our owne eaſe; but that although wee should know, that after this life wee muſt ſuffer paine, yet heere we muſt alſo take courage to ſuffer afflictions for loue, &amp; loue is content

               <p>DOe not conceiue that to be anger in our Lord, which indeede proceedes from true loue. For as he, who beares ill will to another, doth flatter ſometimes, and fawne vpon him; ſo true loue ſometimes corrects and chides. And the holy ſcripture ſaith, <hi>That the woundes, which are giuen by him, who loues, are better, then the falſe kiſſes of him, who hates.</hi> And therefore we doe him an extreame wrong, who reproues or puniſhes vs out of the bowells of his loue, if we thinke or ſay, that he perſecutes vs, as if he

Doe not forgett, that the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene God the Father and vs, is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our lord, by whome we are beloued, and tyed with ſo ſtrong a bond of loue, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is able to vndoe it, if man himſelf do not cutt the knott, by the guilt of mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p>Haue you ſo ſoone forgotten, that the bloud of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> cryes out in the demaunde of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for vs? and that his crye is ſo lowde, as that it drownes the crye of our ſinnes, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard? Doe you not know, that if our ſinnes should ſtill remayne aliue, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> dyed to defeate them, his death should be of litle worth, ſince it could not worke that effect? Let no man ſett a light price vpon that, which was ſo highly valued by Almighty God; that he holdes it for a ſufficient, yea a ſuperaboundant diſcharge, forasmuch as concernes his parte therein, of all the ſinnes of the whole worlde, and of a thouſand worldes, if there were ſo manie.</p>
               <p>They, who are loſt, are not loſt for want of payment, but for want of ſeruing themſelues thereof, by meanes of Faith and Pennance, and the Sacraments of the holie Church. Settle once this truth in your hart, and doe it ſoundly, that Chriſt our lord tooke the buſineſſe of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to his owne charge as verily, as if it had beene his owne; and he calles our ſinnes, his: by the mouth of Dauid, ſaying: <hi>Longè a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute mea, verba delictorum eorum;</hi> And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded pardon for them, though himſelfe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:15877:198"/>committed none; and he deſired with a moſt profound internall loue, that his ſeruants might be beloued, as if he had deſired it for himſelf: and as he deſired it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note> he obtayned it. For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinance of God, he and we are ſo much one thing, that either he and we muſt be beloued, or he and we muſt be abhorred. And ſince he neither is, nor can euer be abhorred, neither can we alſo be ſo, if we be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him, by Faith and Loue. But indeede, becauſe he is beloued, we are alſo beloued, and that iuſtly: becauſe he weighes more, towards the making of vs to be beloued, then we doe, to make him be abhorred. And the Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues his Sonne, more, then he abhorres ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as are conuerted to him. And as one, who was much beloued by his Father, he ſaid to him to this effect: Either loue them, or loue not me; for I offer myſelf in pardon of their ſinnes, to the ende, that they may be incorporated into myſelf. The greater loue ouercame the leſſer hate, &amp; we are beloued, pardoned, and iuſtified: &amp; we haue great hope not to be forſaken there, where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is ſo ſtrong a knott of loue.</p>

And if he giue you an appetite to eate the white, and new bread of conſolation, remitt it back againe to the will of our lord: and be content with being ſure, that you shall haue ſo much of that in the next world, as that the ſweetneſſe thereof, will farre and farre exceede the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which might be due for anie bitterneſſe ſuſtayned in this. And in ſteede of thoſe hard bones, which here they gaue you to be gnawed vpon, by your ſoule: you shall there be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in feeding vpon that moſt ſauorie bread of life, which is God himſelf: and thereof there will neuer be an ende. And therefore hope for this, and comfort yourſelf with this: for the buſineſſe, whereof wee are now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is not fitt for them, who are either of

               <p>You will ſee yourſelf many times in ſuch a kinde of ſtate by theſe afflictions, as that if you conſider them with the ſenſe of flesh and bloud, you will thinke them to be the very markes of hell, and euen a beginning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof; but yet you muſt ſuffer it with patience, though it be without comfort yea and though you do not ſo much as feele your owne confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that ſo you may knowe, what it is, to ſuffer in good carneſt. For as long as a man's confidence is very ſtrong, there is nothing, which can afflicte him very much, but when God hides his face, and ſhewes the ſoule no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but disfauour; and when it is perſecuted by enemies, and yet feeles not the helpe of her good friend, then indeede is it pure ſuffering, and hath a taſte euen of the very torments of hell. You will not then diſcerne any hope, which you may haue to eſcape, but you muſt content yourſelf with this, that you deſpaire not; and let that diſcomfort be accepted by you, in penance for your ſinnes, wherein once you tooke delight, and let it at length ſerue to make you clearely ſee, how litle that is, which you are able to doe of yourſelf. It is but reaſon, that he, who ſinnes by louing and liking himſelf, ſhould pay for it, by being inwardly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly disguſted with himſelf; and that he, who had confidence in himſelf, may ſee, to his coſt, that he is good for nothing.</p>

O that thou wouldſt but let men know, how much reaſon, they haue, who come to giue themſelues to thy ſeruice, not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, vnder the conduct of ſuch a Captaine; and that there is noe accident, which ought to putt anie ſeruant of thine, into ſo great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and feare, as the newes of what thou art ought to giue them comfort. If thou, O lord, wert well knowne, there is no ſoule, which would not loue thee and confide in thee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were ſtrangely wicked.</p>
               <p>For this it is, that thou ſayſt: <hi>It is I, therefore doe not feare.</hi> I am he, who kill, and giue life: I caſt men downe, as low as hell, and I draw them back againe; that is, I afflict a man till he thinkes, he dyes and then againe I refreſh, I recreate, and I giue him life. I caſt men into certaine diſcomforts, which ſeeme hell to them: but when they are there, I forgett them not, but I fetch them from thence, and they are but therefore mortified, that they may be quickened. I ſende them not thither, to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:15877:202"/>remayne there, but that their entry into that ſhadow of hell, may be a meanes to make them eſcape the ſubſtance of that true hell after death, and that they may fly vp to heauen. I am he, who can deliuer you from all affliction, for I am of infinite power. And I am he, who will deliuer you, for I am of infinite goodneſſe; and I am he, who know how to do it, for I am of infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I am your Aduocate for I embraced your cauſe as mine owne. I am your ſurety, for I haue made myſelf ſubiect to all your debts. I am your Lord, who haue purchaſed you with mine owne bloud; and with no meaning to forgett you, but to doe you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if you will ſerue me, becauſe you were bought at ſo high a price. <hi>I</hi> am he, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſo profoundly loued you, that for the loue of you, I haue beene contented to be transformed into you, and to become paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mortall. I, who in mine owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was very farre from being ſubiect to ſuch miſerie. I am he, who deliuered myſelf ouer to innumerable torments of bodie, and farre greater torments of minde, that you might take hart to endure ſome for loue of me, and to confide, that you ſhall in fine, be freed from them, ſince I am he, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. I am your Father, as I am God, and your elder-brother, as I am man. I am your Chriſt, &amp; your redemption, and what feare can you then haue of your debts, if by penance,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:15877:203"/>and Confeſſion, you demaunde a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of them? I am your reconciliation, and of whoſe wrath can you then be afraide?

               <p>My bodie, and my bloud is yours: and why then doe you feare hunger? nay, my verie hart is yours, and why then doe you feare to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? yea and my diuinitie is yours, and what doubt can you then haue of miſerie? For acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories vnto that Principall, my Angells are yours to defende you. My Saints are yours, to pray for you. My <hi>bieſſed mother</hi> is yours, to be the carefull and indulgent mother of you all. The earth is yours, that you may ſerue me vpon it. The heauen is yours, for you shall enioy it, and me in it. The deuills, and hell is alſo yours, for you shall treade it and them vnder foote, like ſlaues, who are chayned vp in that priſon. This life is yours, becauſe with it you gett an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which shall neuer ende. Your honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainements and delights are yours.

               <p>Now, you cannot account yourſelf poore, who poſſeſſe ſo great riches, if you doe not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly throw them away, by your wicked life. Be not diſmayed; for I will not forſake you. It is true, that you are no better, then ſome thinne glaſſes; but I will holde you faſt in my hand. Your weakeneſſe ſetts of, my ſtrength the more. From your ſinnes and miſeries, I draw the manifeſtation of my goodneſſe, and mercie. There is nothing, which shall be able to hurt you, if you will loue me, and confide in me. Thinke not of me according to your owne opinion, and the iudgments, which are made by flesh and bloud; but thinke of me by a ſtrong faith with loue; nor by the apparance of exteriour ſignes, but by that hart of mine, which was opened for you vpon the Croſſe, that you might diſmiſſe all doubt, whether you are beloued by me or no, foraſmuch as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes my parte; ſince you ſee ſuch workes of loue

               <p>Happie are you, if you be found faithfull to the <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> who choſe you. Happie are you, if you haue the courage to caſt away that, which is preſent, vnder the moſt certaine promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord, for that, which is future. Be confident, my good ſiſter, in taking his word: for you are not the firſt, to whome hee hath paſſed it, and fulfilled it: neither shall you be she, with whome that word shall want effecte. He gaue his word to ſaynt Catherine, ſaynt Agnes, ſaynt Barbara and ſaynt Lucie,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:15877:208"/>and to inmumerable other ladie virginis: and tell me now how completely he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. They had the courage to deſpiſe the poore preſent world: and you ſee, that now they raigne with God. They liued heere in trouble; and they are now in an eternitie of repoſe. Through how manie combats did they paſſe? and they now enioy the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting crownes of their conqueſts. They fled from ſpouſes of the earth: and they brought the king of heauen to bee in loue with them.</p>
               <p>If they had followed the trace of this world, their delight had beene alreadie paſt, and their memories would haue beene forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But they loued that, which was eternall; and therefore their felicitie shall not dye: and their memorie shall not decay. They were written in the booke of God: and therefore neither water nor winde, nor fire, nor time can make them waſte. For that booke is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible: and ſo is the name, which is written in it.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore procure to haue a ſtrong hart towards God, whoe is your ſaluation: and doe not thinke, that hee ſelles heauen deare to you: for you haue not yet shed your bloud for him, as thoſe others shed theirs. Our lord treates you like a weake creature: and you should bee a shamed to haue giuen him ſuch cauſe. If you had had more faith and confidence in him,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:15877:209"/>and more loue to ſuffer for him, he would haue procured you more afflictions, to the ende, that you might haue purchaſed richer Crownes. Do not content yourſelf with ſuffering litle, conſidering how great your rewarde ſhall be, and how much Chriſt our Lord ſuffered for you. He gaue his life for you, and he was dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely tormented and deſpiſed. How then come you thus to complaine of the touch of a flye? doe but loue, and you will deſire to ſuffer. Let your loue be doubled, and you will ſuffer ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which are doubled. The loue of our Lord makes ſuch as poſſeſſe it, more greedie of ſuffering, then the loue of ones ſelfe, of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. It makes, that anie burden weighes light, for loue is ſtronger then death. He, who loues not, groanes vnder the burden, like ſome lazie beaſt; but he, who loues, runnes and flyes, and it ſuffers him not to feele the weight euen of his owne bodie, nor of whatſoeuer elſe they can lay vpon it.</p>
               <p>It is not, my good Siſter, that the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which we ſuffer, are great; but that our loue is litle. The weight of a pound is no great weight; but yet lay it vpon ſome litle childe, and he will ſay: <hi>O how heauie it weighes?</hi> whereas if a man tooke it vp, he would ſcarce feele it. And ſo take you it for a ſigne, that if you loue little, your afflictions will weigh heauy vpon you; but if you loue much, you will ſcarce allowe them to be afflictions. For you will be ſo inebriated with loue, that nothing can be able to diſtract
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:15877:209"/>you from the taſte thereof. You will finde a good ſauour in the very ſuffering it ſelf, <hi>and you will draw water out of the rocke;</hi> and hony out of the ſtonie hilles.<note place="margin">

               <p>The true loue of Chriſt our Lord carries this badge with it, in token that it is indeede of him. That as it apprehendes and highly eſteemes the goodneſſe of God; ſo it alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendes and profoundly diſeſteemes the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe

               <p>You therefore muſt be ſure, to carry your eyes open, vpon your owne hart; and when you finde not there a profound contempt, and confuſion of yourſelf, in the high preſence of Almightie God: be you well aſſured, that you are farre from knowing yourſelf; and that you haue yet, no other eyes, but of flesh and bloud; and no true celeſtiall light at all.

               <p>DOe not, Sir, I beſeech you, conceiue anie vnkindeneſſe at my hands, but forgiue me as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith; ſince God hath forgiuen the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which we haue committed againſt him. You know alreadie, how full of faults I am, which might ſuffice to make anie man fayle in the ſeruice, which he owes. Sometimes I haue wanted a meſſenger, as I did, where I haue bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of late, and doe yet remaine; For if no bodie bring me word of anie, I know not, where I am to ſeeke him. I beſeech you, Sir, beleiue, that in a matter of more importance I will haue loue enough for the doeing you ſeruice.</p>
               <p>I holde this diſtruſt of Saluation, to which you tell me, you are ſubiect, for a moſt plaine temptation, Nay, I holde it, not onely to be certaine, but ſottish alſo. For it deſerues no better name, then that, if it will not be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the conſideration of thoſe benefitts, which we poſſeſſe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord, as if this buſineſſe, were the worke of our hands, or the rewarde of our meritts; and not by the grace of God, through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> You muſt therefore
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:15877:220"/>enlarge your litle hart, towards the immenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that loue, wherewith the Father gaue vs his Sonne, and with him, gaue vs himſelf, and the <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if your demeritts fright you, remember, that one of the benefitts, which the Father impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to vs in Chriſt our lord; is the payement of our debts: and the ſweetening, and appeaſing of that wrath, which our ſinnes deſerued.</p>
               <p>Why doe you doubt of a <hi>pardon,</hi> ſince you doubt not of that <hi>Paſsion,</hi> which he endured for our ſinnes?<note place="margin">.Pet. 2.</note> What doth it profitt you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord dyed for vs (<hi>be who was luſt, for vs, that were vniuſt</hi>) if you beleiue not, that his death killed our ſinnes: and now, if they be dead, why do you feare them? For the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> whome our lord drew out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſeing that their enemies were drowned in the ſea, did not feare, but ſung praiſes to our lord: taking occaſion thereof, from thoſe very enemies, who had perſecuted them before; and whome formerly they had feared. And though we haue not ſo aſſured <hi>Faith,</hi> that our ſinnes are pardoned, as we are ſure, that our lord, dyed for them, (becauſe we do not ſo certainly know, that his merits are applyed to vs) yet the new hart, which God gaue vs, when he called vs to himſelf, may be a good ſigne of his friendshipp, and pardon, whereby we may well hope that our ſinnes alſo
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:15877:220"/>are forgiuen. And beſides that <hi>ſpirit</hi> of being his <hi>children,</hi> which he gaue vs, when he imparted his loue, as the loue of a Father to vs, may well be taken for a particular aſſurance, that in the hart of God, we are eſteemed as his ſonnes, ſince in our harts, we eſteeme him as our Father. For it is blaſphemie to affirme, that I louing God, he should not loue me: ſince that loue wherewith I loue him, is neuer giuen me, but by his hand.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, thinke not of our lord,<note place="margin">Sap. 1.</note> with a short hart, &amp; a ſtraite, but in great beleife of his goodneſſe, as we are commaunded. And caſt vp your eyes, to that ſigne of our ſaluation, <hi>Curiſt</hi> our lord; who is the aſſurance of our hope; and who is ſo acceptable to his Father, and by whoſe participation, we are alſo made, acceptable to him, and we haue aſſured hope, through his bloud, to enioy eternall life, before the Throne of God.</p>
               <p>And if it ſeeme to you, that your workes are weake, and poore, it is reaſon you should thinke ſo ſtill. But what reaſon is this, why you should looſe your confidence? By <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord, we were made freinds of enemies; and by him we are conſerued in his friendshipp. We had greater impediments to be well with God, when, we were ſubiect to our ſinnes, before we knew God: then now we haue, by the defects, into which we fall. So that, if our former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, could not hinder that grace, which was communicated to vs in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord: much
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:15877:221"/>leſſe shall our preſent faults, be able to breake of this friendshipp, we being now incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is beloued by his Father.</p>
               <p>A good thing it is for vs to feele our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and miſerie: but yet it muſt be with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that withall, we beleiue highly of the bountie, and riches of the mercie of God. And let vs glorifye his goodneſſe in our wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: ſince with ſo much loue he tolerates his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are ſo faultie, ſo weake, and ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Why should you depriue God of the glorie, to haue great latitude of <hi>loue</hi> towards his children? For by reaſon of the <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> which wee carrie to his ſonne, he hath patience, with the faults, which we committ; when once we haue bewailed them, and done true penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce for them.</p>
               <p>Beleiue therefore now at length, that as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is goodneſſe enough in God, to make you loue him: ſo there is meritt enough in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord, to make you be beloued for his ſake: and liue you with gratitude, for the benefitts, which you haue receiued, as alſo for the pardon of thoſe errours, which you daily committ. And be daily accepting of all good occaſions, and fight the warres of our lord with ioy: as that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Machabeus</hi> did. And God giuing you, that which he giues, you may hope, you shall enioy his kingdome, though perhaps you may be putt to ſuffer in temporall fire, <hi>for the hay, and ſtraw, and wood,</hi> which shall be found in your ſoule.</p>
               <p>Be you euer breathing more and more towards
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:15877:221"/>Profitt in ſpiritt: but yet ſo, as that it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with quietneſſe, grounded vpon Confidence. For though it should grow to be no more, then now it is, euen that being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, will ſuffice for your ſaluation. But if you looke onely vpon yourſelf, we are all ſo full of faults, that your ſoule will neuer bee without diſmay: nor will you perceiue, that you are greatly beloued by our lord. And then proceeding after ſuch a manner as that, how will you be able to ſerue him, and giue guſt, to his <hi>holie ſpirit,</hi> which is dwelling in you. For this <hi>ſpirit is chearefull:</hi> and we checke it, by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and diſmay: againſt which S. Paul thus diſſwades vs, ſaying. <hi>That we muſt not contriſtate the holie ſpirit of our lord.</hi> The ſumme of all is this, that you muſt know, and conſider your faults: and that they muſt ſeeme very great in your eyes: and you muſt bewaile and lamente them by <hi>Confeſsion</hi> and <hi>Penance.</hi> But yet ſtill you muſt conſider, that thoſe benefitts, which we poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our lord, are greater: by reaſon whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, you muſt confide yourſelf to be beloued: and you muſt doe it with much thankefullneſſe. And if God doe no more, but continue that to you, which you haue alreadie, euen that may ſuffiſe, as hath beene ſayd, to make you hope for eternall life.</p>

               <head>A Letter of the Authour to an afflicted woman.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>He declares, that afflictions come either through the fault of the partis, or elſe for tryall, and how one is to carrie himſelf in tribulation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe grace and peace of our lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> be euer with you, Amen. The true loue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith I loue you in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> hath cauſed ſo great compaſſion in me towards you, in reſpect of what you ſuffer, that it hath moued me to write this letter, with deſire, that it may ſerue you to ſome purpoſe. I know not, my good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſiſter, whether I shall putt you into anie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or rather, whether I shall not helpe you to weepe. Nor doe I know, whether or no, I should tell you, that the trouble, which you haue, is good, and that you are to carrie it with ioy; and that I should not graunt, that it is ill, as it ſeemes to you, and that as ſuch you are to fly from it. I ſee, that if manie good men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch accidents, as this, there are alſo very ill men, who endure the ſame. And if to ſome, it be a ſigne of loue, to others it is an effect of the wrath of God. Our lord punishes ſome by theſe meanes, and to others, who deſerue no punishment, he ſendes them as tryalls; and he preſentes them with an occaſion of meritt. And though the thing, which you endure, may proceede from either of theſe two cauſes: vet I
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:15877:222"/>am not ſorrie, that you perſwade yourſelf, that it is not ſo likelie to be a proofe of your vertues, as the punishment of ſome light fault, if that fault may well be accounted light, which deſerues ſo heauie a punishment. For if the ſaints themſelues aknowledge, that there is no goodneſſe in themſelues, but manie faultes, and much wickedneſſe; how much more muſt you doe it, who know yourſelf to be farre from ſanctitie, and ſo full of ſinne?</p>
               <p>And now, if you holde it for more probable that theſe fruits growe from this roote, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie muſt be, that you examine well, if you haue done anie thing, for which you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue punishment. And know, that for the moſt parte, it vſes to be ſome litle duſt of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie: and if you ſee not the true reaſon of it, eſteeme your caſe to be ſo much the worſe, when not withſtanding you are ſo full of faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, you can diſcerne none.</p>
               <p>But now, ſince the blow is come, <hi>humble-yourſelf vnder the mightie hand of God:</hi> as kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that you are worthie of greater torment. Beſeech him, to haue mercie on you, and that he caſt you not of from himſelf. Say: <q>O lord, I haue ſinned, and anie punishment, how sharp ſoeuer, is in itſelf, too light for me: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the greatneſſe of my ſinnes. If thou be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to punish me, here I am, extende the hand, o lord, diſcharge the blow: Cutt, burne, and kill: onely permitt not, that I be diuided, and driuen away from thee.</q> If I haue ſinned, let not
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:15877:223"/>thy punishment be, to let me ſinne anie more, for the naturall punishment of a fault, is payne, and not a ſecond fault.</p>
               <p>But now neuertheleſſe, I would not, that by your thinking your faultes, to haue beene the cauſe of your croſſes, you should diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort yourſelf, and be ſo farre diſmayed, as to make you fall, and that as by ſome precipices into deſpaire. I deſire, on the one ſide, that you humble yourſelf, beleiuing that your ſinnes haue deſerued them, and on the other ſide, that you be comforted by remembring, that you are the childe of God, and none of them, who are forgotten, ſince your father hath beene carefull to correct you as a childe, for feare leaſt elſe you would haue beene worſe. And beleiue me in one thing, though I be no Prophet, that if our lord in his mercie, had not humbled you, as he hath done, you would perhaps haue fallen into ſome parte of Lucifer's pride, which had beene infinitely worſe: and therefore hath he kept you ſo humble, that you neither dare, nor euer ſo much as can, holde vp your head.</p>
               <p>Giue thankes therefore to our lord for this fauour, and be happie in that you haue his grace. But alreadie I know, you will ſay thus to me: <q>If I could be ſure, that I were his childe, and not his enemie: and that this were the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a father, and not the punishment of a Iudge: If I could perſwade myſelf out right, that I were in his fauour, what could I wish for more then that? But I verily beleiue, that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:15877:223"/>vnleſſe it might be hell, there is not ſo wicked a creature, as I am, to be found: and how then can I poſſeſſe ſuch a thing as grace? This life of mine, is not a life of the ſonnes of God: but it is a life, or to ſpeake more truly, it is a verie death of the damned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>O my good ſiſter, if you know the guift of God, and what kinde of people they are, who for the moſt parte are putt to ſuffer ſuch things, as theſe: you would perhaps reioyce. If I ſaw, that the enemyes onely of God, did endure them, infallibly I should be much afflicted: but I finde, that his beſt friends are tempted in this kinde: and why then should I not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted thereby? Iob the holie man,<note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one day in ſo ſad a caſe, that he ſayd: I haue deſpaired. Such things had paſſed in his hart, that he ſeemed to be fallen into deſpayre. But to the ende, that we may ſee, that indeede he did not deſpaire, he inſtantly goes to aske mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and he, who askes mercie, deſpaires not.</p>
               <p>Dauid ſayd, as we all know,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>that God had caſt him cleane out of his ſight, and that he ſaw himſelf couered with obſcuritie, and darkeneſſe, and enuironed euen by the ſorrowes of death, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell.</hi> And he ſayth, that ſuch things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him, as no man will vnderſtand, but he, through whoſe hart they had paſſed.</p>
               <p>I will omitt the tribulations of S. Paul, which were cauſed by Satan, and which made him hang downe the head; for of theſe you haue heard many other times. In the liues of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:15877:224"/>thoſe holie Fathers, I haue read manie things, which I ſhould neuer haue beleiued, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour were not a man of much authoritie. And euen, at this day, we heare and ſee ſtrange things, which arriue to certaine deuout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſeruants of our Lord; and he hath drawen them out of theſe temptations, with great ſpirituall gayne. Whereby we gather: that a man in ſuch caſes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> muſt, like Abraham, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue that, which he ſees not; and hope, euen againſt hope itſelf.</p>
               <p>Tell me, my good Siſter, haue you ſeene theſe potters heate their fornace? Haue you ſeene that ſmoake which is ſo thicke &amp; black? That kindling of fyre, and euen the reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of hell it ſelf, which paſſes there? who would beleiue, but that the potts, which ſtand there within, would be mouldred euen to duſt, by the rage of that fyre? Or that at leaſt, they would not grow to be as fowle as pitch, by the groſſeneſſe of the ſmoake? And yet, when that furie is paſt, and the fire quenched, and the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me come, when they vnfurnace the potts, you ſee, that though they were ſoft, and made of durt, they come forth as hard as ſtone; and they, who formerly were ſo very browne, ſhew themſelues as white as ſnow; and ſo neate and daintie otherwiſe, that they become the table of kings.</p>
               <p>We are called by S. Paul,<note place="margin">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:15877:224"/>knockes of affliction. Make account, that you alſo are ſome poore litle pott, &amp; that they haue putt you out to bake; For you were ſo weake, as that you could not well retaine, and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the liquour of grace, which was infuſed into you by Almightie God.</p>
               <p>They will bake you, my good Siſter, and you muſt haue patience. They haue truſt you into the furnace of tribulation. Endure now thoſe fyres, thoſe foggye flames, and thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities, and by confiding in the wiſedome and goodneſſe of our good potter, you ſhall not be turned into aſhes, which may be carried away by the winde, nor disfigured by anie ill marke, which may be putt vpon you; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhall become hard, in being able to ſuffer; that ſo, though you ſhould fall, you may not breake yourſelf. And you ſhall be alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from that diſgracefull colour, which befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you had; and finally you ſhall be made fitt, and capable to be a veſſell of honour, and to be ſerued vp to the table of Almightie God. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, not to come broken out of the furnace, leaſt they caſt you heere, and there, as a thing of nothing. Thoſe potts are onely broken, which looſe their patience in the furnace of tribulation; but I confide in our Lord, that you will be able to come forth, without any hurt.</p>
               <p>Suffer now a litle, for quickly the whole buſineſſe will be at an ende. Be not you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde, how buſie ſoeuer the deuill be. Let him perſecute you as much as he will, but confide
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:15877:225"/>you in God. It is a ſigne, that the deuill hath no parte in you, ſince he followes you ſo hard. For if he had you in his hand, he would not follow you. It is a ſigne, that you are departed out of his kingdome, ſince he hath diſpatched ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſquadrons of armed men after you.</p>

The waues the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof ſhall ſerue you for a wall, both on the right hand, and on the left; and you ſhall paſſe, without ſo much as wetting your foote, through the midſt of your tribulations, and temptations, whereas your enemies ſhall be drowned therein.</p>
               <p>Doe but conceiue, what ioy that will be, when (all the people of God, being paſſed through the dangerous ſea of this world) the moſt <hi>Bleſſed Virgin Marie</hi> (who was figured in the perſon of that other Marie the ſiſter of Moyſes) ſhall beginne to ſing that Canticle of ſo great triumph;<note place="margin">

               <p>And to the ende, that you may be yet more comforted, know from me, that you haue no cauſe of any ſcruple; for your caſe is rather, that you ſuffer torment, then that you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt ſinne. For ſo that you conſent not freely to thoſe temptations, nor delight yourſelf in thoſe thoughts, which the deuill offers; and deſire not, for your parte, ſo much as to thinke the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, what cauſe of ſcruple can you haue?

               <p>The benefitt, and meritt, which you draw out of the victory, is greater then the preiudice, which you ſuffer in the conflict, and therefore let nothing trouble you.

And carrie yourſelf iuſt ſo, as you would doe, when you should heare a man blaſpheme, or ſpeake anie other fowle deformed wordes; for which, though you would be much in paine, in regarde of the offence, which thereby is done to Almightie God; yet in fine, it would be a kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſome reſpect to you, when you ſaw, that it was not you, who offended him.</p>
               <p>Lett it grieue you, that the deuill doth both ſay, and doe ſo like himſelf: and let it comfort you to conſider, that it is not you, but he, and that he will ſmart for it. S. Paul ſaith, that he gloried in his afflictions, &amp; tribulations: becauſe the vertue and ſtrength of Chriſt our Lord, shined more therein.</p>
               <p>My good Siſter, if indeede you loue Chriſt our Lord; you will reioyce, for that glorie, which he gathers from your infirmity. Doth it not ſeeme to you, that God shewes his ſtrength in you, ſince by the weakeneſſe of a poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable woman, who is indeede but a very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and a ſick creature, and a kinde of nothing, he ouercomes the ſtrength, and courage of thoſe infernall powers? Will not you be then content to be aſſaulted, vpon condition, that Chriſt our Lord may be glorified? Yes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I know you will, and that moſt willingly. Nor can I beleiue leſſe of that charitie, which
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:15877:226"/>you pretende to haue, nor of that deſire, which you carrie, that our Lord may be pleaſed to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue himſelf of you, whether it be in proſperitie, or aduerſity, in ſweete or bitter, by way either of loue, or greife, either in peace, or warre. Our Lord is pleaſed now, that you ſerue him in warre, and vnder the incommodities of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and colde, with your weapons by your ſide, both day and night: being content with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſleepes, and being ſubiect to ſurpriſes, as if you ſtand vpon the toppe of a pike: yea and (though it will afflict you moſt) you muſt contente yourſelf to be farre abſent from your king. But after this ſeaſon, there will come another, and our Lord will commaunde, that you ſhall ſerue him in his banketting-houſe, where you shall enioy as much, as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. In the meane time, you shall ioye in this, that you are doeing him ſeruice. And I beſeech him to ſtrengthen your ſoule, that ſo it may be able to fight the battailles of our Lord, and to make you a conquerour therein, that ſo you may deſerue that Crowne of glorie, which he hath promiſed to ſuch, as ouercome, Amen.</p>
